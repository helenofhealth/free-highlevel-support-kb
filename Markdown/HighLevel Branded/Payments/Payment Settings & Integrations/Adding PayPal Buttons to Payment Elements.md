### **Step 2:** Add or Update the Payment Element

  
* If you are collecting payments in your forms, surveys, websites, or funnels, simply add the payment element to enable PayPal buttons during the checkout experience.
* If you already have a payment element and are now adding PayPal as a payment option, ensure that your Payment Element is updated to the latest version that supports PayPal.

  
Note :

If you are collecting payments in your **Forms or Surveys**, add the **“Collect Payment”** element to enable PayPal buttons during the checkout experience.

If you are collecting payments in your **Funnels or Websites**, use the **1-Step or 2-Step Order Form** elements instead. These now support PayPal automatically — no additional payment element is needed.  

If you added the order form before Nov 1st, 2024, delete it and re-add it to ensure compatibility with PayPal.
