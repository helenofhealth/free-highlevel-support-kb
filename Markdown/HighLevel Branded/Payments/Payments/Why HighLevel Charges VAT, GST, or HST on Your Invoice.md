**Q: Why is HighLevel charging me VAT/GST/HST?**

A: HighLevel is charging VAT/GST/HST to comply with international tax regulations. 

  
The application of VAT/GST may depend on your jurisdiction. Most customers will only be charged VAT/GST if they did not provide a tax ID number in their billing profile. Some jurisdictions (such as Mexico, Switzerland, South Africa, Malaysia, Indonesia, Serbia, and some Canadian provinces) require that we charge VAT/GST even if the customer has provided a tax ID. 

  
**Q: When will the tax charges begin?**

A: While exact timing will depend on your jurisdiction, you can expect to see VAT/GST charges added to your invoices in early 2025.

  
**Q: Is VAT/GST/HST being charged to all international customers?**

A: Yes, HighLevel will charge VAT/GST where ever applicable; however, certain exceptions may apply. For example, VAT/GST will not be collected in the following situations:

* Your country does not require taxation on sales to registered businesses and you have provided a Tax ID number in your billing profile.
* HighLevel has determined, in its sole discretion, that VAT/GST is not applicable to the transaction. Please note that tax laws are subject to change from time-to-time, and such changes in law may impact the applicability and/or amount of tax invoiced.

  
**Q: I provided my Tax ID number in my profile. Why am I being charged VAT/GST/HST?**

A: You are being charged VAT/GST because certain countries require taxes to be applied to all customers, including B2B customers who have provided a tax ID number. These countries include, but may not be limited to: South Africa, Mexico, Switzerland, Serbia, Malaysia, Indonesia, and some Canadian provinces.

**Q: I checked the box that said “I don’t have a Tax ID number” and now I’m being charged VAT/GST/HST. But I recently found my Tax ID number. Can I get a refund of the tax I’ve already paid?**
