* If you add a one time product and recurring product together in the list, the one time product will only be charged to the user in the first invoice.
* You can also add a recurring schedule to your Document templates  
with capability to assign start date as the completed date of the document.

* Add recurring as well as one time products in the product list
* If a recurring product is added, add a schedule from the product list properties and set invoice sending date as document completed date or a custom date. (Enabled in templates as well)
* Once the document is completed, an invoice will be sent (recurring if at least 1 recurring product was added, One time if none was added)
* Set up fee associated with a product is shown separately in the product list

Why did we build it?

* In our effort to streamline acceptance of invoices after Document Signature, recurring products and set up fee of products were stopping a lot of you from using contracts. No longer.

What's next on Payments via Documents and Contracts

* 2 In 1 Documents: Showing invoice directly after primary signer signs the document
* One time Deposit: Collecting a %age of the total product value in the invoice
