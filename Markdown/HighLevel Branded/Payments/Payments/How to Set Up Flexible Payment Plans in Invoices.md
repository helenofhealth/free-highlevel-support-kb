We are excited to announce capability to add Payment plans to invoices

What's New?

* Users can now split their invoices into a payment plan installments
* A split can be made both on Percentage basis as well as amount basis
* Each split carries with it a Due Date and Payment Status of that split. Notifications will go on split's due date reminding user to Pay their installment (if not paid already)
* Payments can be done only in predefined split and user can choose to pay one or more installment at a go. An Invoice will get paid once all installment are paid.

How to use?

Why this feature?

We are solving one major use case here: For medium to large ticket invoices, we have often gotten a requirement that user wants to pay their invoices in installments. While we already have Partial payment, that gives control to payer of invoice to control what amount to be paid when, With this feature, we are giving control in hands of Payee of invoice of the installment size in which Invoice should get paid.

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

  
**Q: Can I customize the reminder emails sent for scheduled invoice installments?**

The reminder emails for each due installment are automatically sent by the system on the due date and are not editable or previewable. Only the main invoice email is configurable using the Email Template in invoice settings.
