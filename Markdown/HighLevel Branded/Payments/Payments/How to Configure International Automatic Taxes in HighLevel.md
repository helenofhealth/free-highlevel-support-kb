Nexus addresses define where your business has a tax obligation. Properly managing these ensures taxes are applied only where required.

* Add or remove countries/states as your business expands or contracts.
* Deleting a country with separately added states (like Canada) will also remove those states from the Nexus Addresses list.
* Regularly review and update nexus addresses to stay compliant with changing regulations.
