We are excited to announce that Buy Now Pay Later (BNPL) payment methods are now supported in Order Forms and Payment Links. This is applicable for both 1-step and 2-step order forms. Business users can now offer the following BNPL options to their customers:

* Klarna
* Affirm
* Afterpay/Clearpay

Key Points:

* Availability: This feature is available only for businesses using Stripe as their payment provider.
* Applicable Products: BNPL options are available for one-time products only, not for recurring products.
* Benefits: Offering BNPL methods can help increase conversions by providing payment flexibility to customers.
* Order & Transaction Details: All order and transaction details will be recorded under the Payments menu, similar to credit card payments. Existing triggers for Order Submitted and Payment Received will function as usual
* This change requires migration from Stripe and would be already available for some accounts and progress for others
