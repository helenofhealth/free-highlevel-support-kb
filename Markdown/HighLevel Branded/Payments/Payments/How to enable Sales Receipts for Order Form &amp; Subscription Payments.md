## **Frequently Asked Questions**

  
**Q:** **Can I send sales receipts automatically for only certain types of payments?**

No, enabling sales receipts applies globally to all payments made through order forms, calendar bookings, and invoices. If you want selective receipt handling, you would need to disable automatic receipts and send them manually for specific payments.
  
  
**Q: Can sales receipts include custom fields or personalized messages?**

Currently, sales receipts do not support adding custom fields or personalized messages beyond standard transaction details. However, you can customize the email template associated with the sales receipt to include a general message or branding elements.
  
  
**Q: Are sales receipts sent immediately after a payment is processed?**

Yes, sales receipts are sent automatically to the customer as soon as the payment is successfully processed. However, delays may occur depending on email delivery factors outside of HighLevel's control, such as the recipient's email server.
  
  
**Q: How can I verify if a sales receipt was successfully delivered to a customer?**

You can verify whether a sales receipt was successfully delivered by checking the Email Reporting section within your subaccount. To access it, navigate to Marketing > Emails > Email Reporting. Once there, you can use filters to search by the recipient’s email address or the subject line of the receipt email. The reporting dashboard will show the delivery status—such as whether the email was delivered, opened, or bounced—helping you confirm if your customer received the receipt.
