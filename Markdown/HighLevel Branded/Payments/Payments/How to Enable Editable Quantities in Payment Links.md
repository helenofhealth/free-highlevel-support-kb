## **What's New?**

* We’ve added a new feature that lets your customers edit product quantities directly on the payment links you send them.
* This means they can adjust the number of items they want to buy before they complete their purchase.

## **How to Use?**

* When you’re creating a payment link, you’ll now see an option to allow "Let customers adjust quantities."
* Check the box
* Set minimum and maximum quantities

* Share the payment link as you normally would.
* Users can then edit the quantity and then pay the total amount.

* Plus, it’s something our users have been asking for, and we’re always listening to your feedback!
