Let's say you have a product with an initial setup fee and then a monthly recurring charge. So far, you were not able to use a single invoice to let the customer pay for both and had to rely on 2 invoices. Not anymore. 

What's new

* You can now add a recurring product -> add a set up fee to it in its prices -> Add it to a recurring invoice -> 2 line items for the same product (One with Setup fee and other with recurring price) would appear
* For subsequent invoices, the setup fee line item will be removed and only the recurring part of the price will be sent out

How to use?

* Go to Product section and create a product with price type = recurring and add a setup fee to it

* Create a recurring invoice from invoices section

* 2 line items for the same product will be shown with the Suffix "Setup Fee" added to the setup part of the price

* For all subsequent invoices that are auto-generated as per your schedule, will only have the recurring element of the price.

Why did we build this?

* For all service providers where a signing fee was to be collected along with monthly recurring charges, this feature would make invoices super useful to them
