**Q: How can I integrate third-party payment processors?**

HighLevel supports integration with popular payment processors like Stripe and PayPal. You’ll need to connect your account via the integrations section in the platform. Once linked, you can accept payments directly through your invoices.

  
**Q: Why does an invoice show “Payment Processing” even after a client has paid?**

If your invoice shows “Payment Processing,” it means the payment has been initiated but not yet settled. This typically happens with ACH bank transfers or payment methods like PayPal eCheck, which require 2–5 business days to clear. Once the payment is successfully processed, the invoice status will automatically update to “Paid.”
