## **Frequently Asked Questions**

  
**Q:** **Are there any fees associated with accepting ACH Direct Debit payments through Stripe?** 

Yes, Stripe applies specific fees for processing ACH Direct Debit payments, which differ from standard card transaction fees. For the most current pricing details, please refer to Stripe's official pricing page.
  
  
****Q: Can I use ACH Direct Debit for recurring invoices with auto-payments enabled?** 

Yes, ACH Direct Debit can be used for recurring invoices with auto-payments enabled. When setting up a recurring invoice, you can enable auto-payments by toggling the auto-pay option during the invoice sending process. This allows subsequent payments to be automatically charged on scheduled payment dates.
  
  
****Q: How can I manage which payment methods are displayed to my customers on invoices?** 

You can manage the payment methods displayed to your customers by configuring settings in your Stripe dashboard. Navigate to Settings > Connect > Payment Methods in Stripe, select the appropriate configuration (e.g., Invoice, InvoiceWithAutopayment), and enable or disable specific payment methods as desired.
  
  
****Q: What should I do if an ACH Direct Debit payment fails due to insufficient funds or other reasons?** 

If an ACH Direct Debit payment fails, Stripe will notify you of the failure reason, such as insufficient funds or an invalid account number. It's advisable to contact the customer to resolve the issue, which may involve updating their bank account information or selecting an alternative payment method.

  
**Q: How can I save a customer’s ACH bank account for future payments?**

When a customer pays an invoice using ACH Direct Debit and selects auto-pay (if available), Stripe will securely store the bank account as a payment method on file for future use.

If auto-pay is not selected, you’ll need to use Stripe’s customer management features to manually save the bank account for reuse. You can also ask the customer to make a payment using a payment link that saves their bank account by default (e.g., recurring payment setup).
