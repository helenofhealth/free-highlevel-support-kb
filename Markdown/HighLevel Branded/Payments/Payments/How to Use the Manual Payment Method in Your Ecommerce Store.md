## **How to use**

### **Manual Payment Method setup:**

1. Store owners can setup manual payment methods for their e-commerce stores at: Payment > Integrations > Manual Payment Methods.
2. Initially, store owners can choose either Cash on Delivery or create their own Custom Payment Method.
3. Once a payment method is added, Payment Instructions and Messages are optional fields during setup.
4. Store owners can enable manual payment methods for either the Order Form or E-commerce Stores. These options will appear at checkout only if enabled at this step.
5. Store owners must click Save to apply the changes.

### **Collect Payment flow (for manual payment method orders):**

1. Post receiving the order, store owners can record collected payment at: Payment > Orders > Select the Order > "Collect Payment" CTA.
2. Store owners can collect a payment and define the Payment Mode from dropdown. Notes (optional) can be added as well.
3. Once marked as paid, transaction status will get updated along with the mode of payment.

## **Notes:**

* A manual payment method can be set up when a payment integration is already connected in the current version.
* If a recurring product is part of the order, manual payment methods won't show up at checkout.
* Collect order flow is applicable for Manual Payment Method orders only. Once marked as paid, it can't be reverted.
* If the payment method isn't enabled for either the  
 E-commerce stores  
 and  
Order Forms  
, it won't appear on the checkout page.
* Store owners can set up both  
Cash on Delivery  
 and  
Custom Payment Method  
 simultaneously.
