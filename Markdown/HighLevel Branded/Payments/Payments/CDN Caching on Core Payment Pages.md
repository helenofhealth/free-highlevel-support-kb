# What is CDN Caching?

CDN (Content Delivery Network) Caching is a powerful performance enhancement method that distributes static content across globally located servers. By serving data from the closest edge server, CDN Caching reduces latency and accelerates page load times, especially on high-traffic, customer-facing pages. This ensures a seamless and efficient experience for end users during payment activities.

# Key Benefits of CDN Caching

CDN Caching has delivered measurable improvements in performance, user experience, and potential revenue growth for businesses using HighLevel's payment systems.

* Up to 78% faster page loads on critical customer-facing pages
* Reduced load time from 4.6s to 1.3s on invoice pages
* Higher payment conversion rates due to improved speed
* Frictionless experience on mobile and desktop platforms
* Improved performance across international geographies
* Direct revenue boost tied to faster load times

# How We Implemented CDN Caching

We focused on optimizing content delivery on the most frequently used payment interfaces. Static assets such as HTML, JavaScript, and style sheets were strategically cached via our CDN provider, ensuring ultra-fast access.

Performance Results:

| Page Type                 | Before Load Time | After Load Time | % Improvement |
| ------------------------- | ---------------- | --------------- | ------------- |
| Invoices                  | 4.6 seconds      | 1.3 seconds     | \~71%         |
| Estimates                 | \~4.5 seconds    | \~1.3 seconds   | \~70%+        |
| Payment Links             | \~4.5 seconds    | \~1.3 seconds   | \~70%+        |
| Receipts                  | \~4.5 seconds    | \~1.3 seconds   | \~70%+        |
| Shippo Marketplace        | Improved         | Improved        | Yes           |

# Frequently Asked Questions

Q: Will all clients see the same improvements?  
 Most clients using standard HighLevel-hosted payment pages will benefit immediately from these optimizations.

Q: Does this interfere with real-time updates or analytics?  
 No, we’ve ensured dynamic content is excluded from caching while maintaining full support for analytics and real-time transaction tracking.

Q: What if I need to clear the cache?  
 CDN Caching is intelligently managed. Changes to content or configurations are automatically propagated to the CDN.

Q: Does this affect custom domains?  
 If you're using HighLevel’s domain routing and page templates, the benefits are automatically applied—even with custom domains.

# Next Steps

* Measure load performance in your own HighLevel account using Chrome’s Dev Tools
