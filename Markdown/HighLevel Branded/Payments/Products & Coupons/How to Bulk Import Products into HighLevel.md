### **Step 2:** Download the Sample CSV

2. A pop-up will appear. At the bottom, you’ll find an option to download a sample CSV file.
3. Download this file to understand the required format and fields.

### **Step 3:** Prepare Your CSV File

1. Open the sample CSV file using Excel, Google Sheets, or any preferred spreadsheet tool.
2. Fill out the necessary fields for each product. Required fields may include:  
   * Product Name  
   * Price  
   * SKU  
   * Description  
   * Category
3. Ensure each field matches the format in the sample file to avoid errors during import.
4. Save your completed file as a .csv.

  
**Quick Tip:** _Double-check your data for duplicate SKUs or special characters that could cause issues._

  
Some fields in the sample file (like weight, inventory, or image source) may not be applicable if you’re importing services. That’s okay — simply leave those fields blank, but do not delete the column headers. All column headers must remain intact to avoid formatting errors.

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

  
**Can I update existing products using a CSV import?**

No, CSV import cannot update existing products

  
**What happens if there are errors in my CSV file during the import process?**

Error messages would be displayed on the screen that have to be resolved and file needs to be uploaded again

  
**Is there a limit to how many products I can import in a single CSV file?**

10MB

  
**Q: I’m importing services, not physical products. What should I do about fields like weight or inventory that don’t apply to me?**

If you’re importing non-physical products (like services), you can leave the irrelevant fields (e.g., weight, dimensions, image source, inventory) blank, but you must still include those column headers in your CSV file.

Removing columns entirely or changing the header names will result in errors such as “Column 1 is not correct.” Always follow the exact column structure from the sample CSV, even if some values are left empty.

  
**Will importing a CSV file overwrite my existing product data in HighLevel?**

No, products cannot be updated using this functionality, so overwriting is not possible.
