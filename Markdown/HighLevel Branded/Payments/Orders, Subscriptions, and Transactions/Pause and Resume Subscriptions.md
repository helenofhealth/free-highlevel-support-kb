Our flexible ‘Pause and Resume Subscription’ feature gives customers the freedom to temporarily pause one of their subscription whenever they need, without having to cancel it entirely. This ensures they won’t lose their account history or preferences and can resume exactly where they left off whenever they’re ready. It’s a convenient, customer-centric option that adapts to their changing needs.

  
Below are the steps you can follow :

  
Go to Payments > Subscriptions.

From the list of subscriptions, hover over the one you wish to pause/resume. Click the Three dots menu.

Below are two methods that allow you to set your your pause/resume preferences.  
**1\. Indefinite :** with this method you can keep the subscription paused without any time limit. You can manually resume any time you wish.

**2\. Custom Date :** This method gives you the ability to choose the custom date so you don't have to manually pause/resume the subscription. This is useful when you are certain about the duration for which the subscription will be on a pause mode. Even if you decide to resume before the date, you can always do it manually. Selecting specific date doesn't restrict you from resuming at any time.

**Invoice Behaviour**  
While pausing subscriptions on every payment due date an invoice would be generated, customers would get an option to get these invoices in draft or void state.

  
**Mark as void -** This option allows you to stop generating invoices for the specific time period.

**Draft option -** Draft option is useful when you want to keep the invoices in a draft mode from where they can be later sent to the customer.

At any point you decide to resume the "Paused" subscription, you can just manually go to three dots menu and click the "Resume" button. A new popup will ask you to confirm your selection and you will have the subscription turned from **"Paused"** to a **"Resume"** mode
