## What does the status of the subscription represent?

| **Status** | **Stripe**            | **Paypal**                 |
| ---------- | --------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Trial      | trialing              |                            |
| Active     | active                | active                     |
| Canceled   | canceled              | canceled                   |
| Suspended  |                       | suspended                  |
| Failed     | incomplete\_expired   |                            |
| Incomplete | incomplete, past\_due | approval pending, approved |
| Unpaid     | unpaid                |                            |
| Expired    |                       | expired                    |

  
We have bucketed the status of the subscription in Stripe and Paypal according to the above mapping. Refer here to know what these status subscriptions mean in [Stripe](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/subscriptions/overview#subscription-statuses) and [Paypal](https://developer.paypal.com/docs/api/subscriptions/v1/#subscriptions%5Fcreate)

## Will these subscription statuses remain in sync with Stripe / Paypal?

  
* **For Stripe,** the subscription status and payments received will remain in sync with what is happening in your Stripe dashboard. For example, if you cancel the subscription on Stripe, it will reflect as Canceled in your subscriptions list as well. All the upcoming payments received will also remain in sync with your Stripe dashboard.
* The subscription status will not remain in sync if the subscription was created on **Paypal.** Also, in case the subscription was created on Paypal, the subscription details will as of now not capture the upcoming payments as well. The subscription entry will get created though for you to track the subscriptions that got created via Paypal.

## Will the subscriptions page contain the list of subscriptions that did not get created because of payment failure on the order form?

  
No, in case the payment failed while making the first payment for the subscription while submitting the order form, it would not get registered on the subscriptions page. You can still track the contact as the contact will get created in both 1-step and 2-step order forms.

## What is not contained on the subscriptions page?
