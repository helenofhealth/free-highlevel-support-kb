## **What's New?**

* Businesses can now add subscriptions directly from Payments > Subscriptions > Add Subscription
* They can also add subscriptions from the Contact's detail page enabling quicker addition of a subscription for the customer - Contacts > Contact Details > Payments > Actions > Create Subscription
* While adding subscriptions using either options, they can also be scheduled for a future date by picking a specific Billing Date to start the subscription and associated payment collections
* The feature allows users to add a new subscription by selecting the customer and product, and completing payment using any of the existing cards on file or by adding a new card - all in a single flow
* A new Invoice can also be added directly from the Contact's detail page where user will be redirected to invoice creation with the customer details pre-filled - Contacts > Contact Details > Payments > Actions > Create Invoice

## **What's Next?**

* Further enhancements on Subscriptions like Pause/Resume Subscriptions
* This would allow subscriptions to be paused for a fixed or indefinite duration and can be resumed automatically (fixed duration) or manually
