# **What is Failed Payment Retry Configuration?**

With the latest update, businesses can now configure automatic payment retries in case of a payment failure for subscriptions. This feature allows greater flexibility in managing payment failures and ensures a smoother subscription renewal process.

  
## **Key Benefits of Failed Payment Retry Configuration**

Configuring failed payment retries provides several advantages:

* **Customizable Retry Attempts** – Define up to 3 retries based on business needs, with configurable gaps of 1, 3, 5, or 7 days between each retry.
* **Default Retry Setup** – By default, the system is configured to attempt 3 retries with a gap of 1 day each, but this can be modified as needed.
* **Impact on Existing and New Subscriptions** – Changes in retry settings will apply to both new and existing subscriptions, ensuring uniformity across all transactions.
* **Subscription Handling on Failure** – If all retries fail, users have the option to either keep the subscription in an ‘Unpaid’ state or automatically move it to a ‘Cancelled’ state by selecting a checkbox in the settings.

## **How to Configure Failed Payment Retries**

Configuring payment retries is simple and can be done in a few steps:

1. **Navigate to Subscription Settings** – Go to `Payments > Settings > Subscription` in your account.
2. **Define Retry Attempts** – Select the number of retries (up to 3) based on your business requirements.

3. **Set Retry Gaps** – Choose the gap duration between retries (1, 3, 5, or 7 days).

4. **Modify Existing Configurations** – Any changes to retry settings will be applied to both new and ongoing subscription retries.
5. **Manage Subscription Status on Final Failure** – Enable or disable the option to move failed subscriptions to the ‘Cancelled’ state automatically.

6. **Save Settings** – Once configured, save your settings to apply changes immediately.

## **Example Scenario**

If a subscription is set to ‘3 retries with a gap of 3 days for each retry’ and one retry has already been attempted, but before the second retry, the settings are updated to ‘2 retries with a gap of 3 and 5 days respectively,’ then:

* The second retry will occur after 5 days instead of 3.
* No third retry will take place.

## **Supported Payment Providers**

This feature is available for the following payment providers:

* **NMI**
