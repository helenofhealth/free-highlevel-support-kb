# **What Are Payment Links for Multiple Products?**

  
Payment Links in HighLevel allow you to combine several products—both one-time and recurring—into a single checkout experience. This is especially useful for businesses offering bundled packages, digital goods, and subscription services. Instead of creating separate links for each item, everything can be managed under one unified payment flow, improving the customer journey and backend tracking.
