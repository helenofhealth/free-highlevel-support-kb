## **What are Mobile Payments: Create Estimates Using Templates?**

  
Estimate Templates on mobile let you start a new estimate from a prebuilt template that lives in the HighLevel web app. Your mobile app reads those web templates, so reps can create consistent, error‑free estimates without rebuilding layout, line items, or terms from scratch.

## **Key Benefits of Mobile Payments: Create Estimates Using Templates**

  
Understanding the benefits helps you decide when to use templates versus creating from scratch in the builder. Templates shine when you need speed, brand consistency, and predictable pricing.

  
* **Time‑saving:** create new estimates in a few taps using prebuilt templates.
* **Consistency:** keep branding, sections, and pricing formats uniform across reps.
* **Mobility:** generate and send estimates from anywhere while with the client.
* **Seamless access:** templates built on the web are automatically available on mobile.
* **Professionalism:** Reduce manual errors and present polished quotes every time.

## **Availability & Prerequisites**

  
A quick readiness check prevents setup issues later. Confirm app versions and where templates are managed so your team can use them on mobile immediately.

  
* Mobile app version: **HighLevel v3.98.1** or **LeadConnector v3.98.1**.
* Whitelabeled apps: contact your account manager/support to **request the v3.98.1 update**.
* Templates are **created and managed on the web**. Mobile can **use** templates but cannot create/edit/delete them.
* Ensure the user has access/permissions to the sub‑account and Payments > Estimates.
