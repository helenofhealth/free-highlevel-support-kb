 2\. Open the invoice that is in **Partially Paid** status.

 3\. Click **Edit** next to any of the following sections:

 • **Invoice Details**: Update the invoice name, due date, terms, or notes.

 • **Products**: Add/remove products or create a new product instantly.

 • **Amounts and Business Info**: Adjust pricing, taxes, or business details.

 • **Payment Schedule**: Edit existing schedules or add/delete payment milestones.
