## **LC Migrator - One-Click Migration**

  
Previously, migrating a WordPress site meant installing third-party plugins like All-in-One Migrator, creating backups, downloading massive files, and then uploading them again to HighLevel. For larger sites, this could take hours—definitely tiring! ?

  
We’ve completely streamlined your migration experience with our brand-new LC Migrator plugin. Just log in, select your site, click a few buttons, and relax. What used to take hours now takes just a few minutes!

  
**Key Features**

* **One-Click Migration:** Start the migration directly from the LeadConnector plugin.
* **Zero Downtime:** Your original site stays live while we handle things in the background.
* **Clear Progress Updates:** Stay updated every step of the way, from backup to verification.
