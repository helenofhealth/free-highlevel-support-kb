## Agency Business + HighLevel Technology

You have your agency business and HighLevel has technology that helps run an agency and can be sold directly to clients as-is. Let's clarify how all the pieces fit together.

  
### Starting Terms

* **Agency**: Your business.
* **Client**: Your business' customer(s).
* **Agency Account**: When your Agency subscribes to HighLevel you get an Agency Account in the platform. This is what you log in to when you log into your agency. The Agency Account has some unique functions, like the SaaS Configurator, that are not in the Sub-Accounts.
* **Sub-Account**: In the HighLevel platform, your Agency Account can create multiple Sub-Accounts. These Sub-Accounts have functions that are not in the Agency Account, like websites, workflows, phone, email, products, and many more. This is also written differently, but Sub-Account = Subaccount = subaccount = sub-account.
* **Agency Subaccount**: Where you run your Agency business.
* **Client Subaccount**: Where your client runs their business.
* **Snapshot Subaccount**: Where you create a reusable template for a Client Subaccount.
* **Test Subaccount**: Where you make a subaccount just to test a snapshot you got from someone else or to see how some functions work before committing them to your main Snapshot Subaccount.
* **Location**: This is another term for an active subaccount, often used interchangeably. Location = Subaccount.

  
### Agency Subaccount

So, after you subscribe to HighLevel and get your Agency Account, you will create a Sub-Account for yourself. This will be an "Agency Subaccount". You will put your Agency domain, website, payment processor, workflows, etc here. Your agency is a business and this subaccount is where you run your business.

  
### Client Subaccount

After you have your Agency Subaccount setup and you sell your first offer to your first client you will create a Sub-Account for them. You will go on to create a new Sub-Account for each client. Clients of your agency business can have multiple HighLevel Sub-Accounts (ex: multiple franchise locations). These are "Client Subaccounts". The Client Subaccount is where your client runs their business.

  
### Miscellaneous Subaccounts

You will probably find that you create subaccounts for other purposes. For example, when you want to create a snapshot so you can setup a new client quickly and easily, you will create a new subaccount. In this "Snapshot Subaccount" you will configure everything the way you want it for a fresh new client. Then you will create a Snapshot from the subaccount and push that snapshot into new Client Subaccounts. You will maintain this Snapshot Subaccount so that when you improve your snapshot you can push a new one into all your Client Subaccounts.

  
You also might create new subaccounts to test things out. That's okay! Just give them names that make the purpose clear.

  
### Locations

You will sometimes see Sub-Accounts referred to as "Locations". That's because most HighLevel end users are small businesses with physical locations or serving a local area. When a Sub-Account is assigned to a Client it becomes a Location (even if the client's business isn't relevant to a physical location like selling digital products).
