# Why Cold Outreach?

  
In short, we do cold outreach because it's effective, it can produce results quickly, and, most importantly, **it's extremely cost effective**.

  
## Warming Up

  
Before you get started, you should think about warming up a new email address so you don't run the risk of getting your main business domain/emails flagged as spam.

  
The easiest way to do this by following these steps:

  
1) Purchase a fresh domain. If your agency's domain is youragency.com, you could purchase something like [youragency.co](//youragency.co) or your agency.mail, etc.

  
2) Create a Google Workspace account , register the new domain in Google Workspace, then create an email for that domain in Google Workspace (something like [mail@youragency.co](mailto:mail@youragency.co)). Note, Google Workspace charges $6/month per email address.

  
3) Sign up for 10-20 newsletters/services using the new email address so that emails start naturally flowing into the account. Here are some good ones: [Twitter](https://twitter.com), [Moz](https://moz.com/moztop10), [Unbounce](https://unbounce.com/blog/), [Convince & Convert](https://www.convinceandconvert.com/newsletter/), [The Daily Carnage](https://carney.co/daily-carnage/), [Neil Patel](https://neilpatel.com/newsletter/), [Seth Goden](https://seths.blog/subscribe/), [Buffer](https://buffer.com/resources/newsletter), [Marketing Drive](https://www.marketingdive.com/signup/), [Total Annarchy](https://annhandley.com/newsletter/), [Sketchalaytics](https://www.ceralytics.com/newsletter-sign-up/).

  
4) Send 10-20 emails to friends/family and make sure they reply.

  
After a few days of emails going in and out of your new email account, the email address and domain will be "warmed up" and ready to go.
