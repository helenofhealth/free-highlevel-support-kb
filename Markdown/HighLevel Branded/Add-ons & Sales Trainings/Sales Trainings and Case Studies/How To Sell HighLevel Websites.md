Websites can be one of the best products to offer your clients because they dramatically increase client retention. 

  
In this presentation we cover why websites are a great product for you to sell, three opportunities to look for when selling websites, and some common pitfalls to avoid along the way.

  
**Website Audit**

  
As mentioned in the presentation, a website audit that you can run potential website clients through is a great sales tool. Here are some ideas for audit questions: 

  
* Does the page load quickly? (Use <https://tools.pingdom.com/> or <https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/>)
* Does the site look good on a phone?
* Is there a clear value statement heading above the fold?
* Is there a call to action above the fold?
* Does the site contain all critical business info?
* Are all fonts easy to read?
* Does site have unique imagery?
* Is there 20px of spacing between elements?
* Are elements evenly spaced?
* Does the site have trust symbols/testimonials?
