# **Migrate Forms and Workflows**

  
### **Step 1:** Review Existing JotForm Workflows

* **List Active Workflows:** Identify and document all workflows triggered by form submissions in JotForm, such as email notifications, data routing, and integrations with other tools.

### **Step 2:** Recreate Workflows in HighLevel

* **Create Automation Triggers:**  
   * In HighLevel, navigate to Automation > Workflows.  
   * Set up triggers for each form submission that replicates the logic from your JotForm workflows (e.g., sending notifications, updating contact records).
* **Rebuild Actions and Conditions:**  
   * Recreate actions such as sending confirmation emails, tagging contacts, or updating CRM records.  
   * Set up any necessary conditions or branching logic to mirror your existing workflows.
  
  
### **Step 3:** Test Workflows
