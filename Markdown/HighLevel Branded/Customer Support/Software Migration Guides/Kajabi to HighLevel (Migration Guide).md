# **Migrate Contacts**
  
  
### **Step 1:** Export Contact List from Kajabi

  
* Navigate to the **Contacts** tab in Kajabi.
* Select all contacts and use the **bulk action dropdown** to export as a CSV file.
* The CSV file will be emailed to the address associated with the Kajabi account. Download this file promptly as the link expires in 3 days.
  
  
### **Step 2:** Prepare CSV for HighLevel Import

  
* **Check Date Formats:** Ensure all date fields in the CSV are in the YYYY-MM-DD format. This is essential for compatibility with HighLevel.
* **Encode Special Characters:** Make sure the CSV file uses UTF-8 character encoding to properly handle special and accented characters.
* **Clean Up Data:** Remove any line breaks, emojis, and unnecessary special characters from the file. This step helps prevent import errors.
* **Recreate Custom Fields:** Log in to HighLevel and navigate to **Contacts > Settings > Custom Fields**. Add custom fields to store contact data in a similar way to how they were stored in Kajabi.
  
  
### **Step 3:** Import Contacts into HighLevel

  
* **Log in to HighLevel:** Navigate to the **Contacts** section using the left-hand menu.
* **Start Import Process:** Click the **Import Contacts** button.
* **Upload CSV File:** Select and upload the prepared CSV file.
* **Map Fields:** HighLevel will prompt you to map the fields from the CSV file to the corresponding fields in HighLevel. For example, map “First Name” in the CSV to “First Name” in HighLevel.  
    
   * _**Field Mapping Tip:** Ensure all required fields are correctly mapped. If a field in your CSV does not have a corresponding field in HighLevel, you may need to create a custom field in HighLevel before proceeding._
* **Assign Tags and Lists:** During the import process, you can assign contacts to specific lists and apply tags. Consider applying a tag that indicates the source of the contacts, such as "Course A - Enrolled" or “Imported from Kajabi.”
* **Complete Import:** After mapping all fields and setting tags/lists, click Import. HighLevel will process the import, and the contacts will be added to your account.

### **Step 2:** Recreate Kajabi Calendars in HighLevel

### **Step 1:** Recreate Website Pages and Funnels in HighLevel

  
* **Access the Site Builder**: Navigate to **Sites > Funnels & Websites** in HighLevel to get started.
* **Use the Template Library**: Browse and choose templates that best match your Kajabi pages. This will speed up your setup and maintain a cohesive design. [Learn more about the Template Library here](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/48001236650-how-does-the-template-library-work-#How-to-access-the-Template-Library-in-Funnels-and-Websites).

### **Step 3:** Set up DNS Records

  
* **Add an A Record**: Use `162.159.140.166`for root domains or subdomains.  
    
   * _**Example:** [yoursitename.com](http://text.yoursitename.com/)_  
   * _**Note:** If using Cloudflare, set the **Proxy Status** to **DNS Only** as HighLevel does not support Cloudflare Proxy._
* **Add a CNAME Record**: Use `[sites.ludicrous.cloud](http://sites.ludicrous.cloud/)` for subdomains in your domain registrar (e.g., GoDaddy or Cloudflare).

* For root domains, enable the **www redirect** to point traffic to your main domain.
  
  
### **Step 5:** Link the Domain to a Funnel or Website
