# **Migrate Forms**

  
Typeform helps user collect information through forms, surveys, and polls and all responses can be downloaded in a CSV.
  
  
### **Step 1:** View TypeForms

* **View Form Questions:** Click on each form to view each form question on the left side of the form preview screen.
* **Document Existing Automations:** Review any existing automation sequences in Typeform, including form logic, calculations, email validation, and notifications.
  
  
### **Step 2:** Recreate Questions in HighLevel

* **Log in to HighLevel:** Go to Contacts > Settings > Custom Fields.
* **Recreate form questions:** Add Custom Value Folders for all Form Questions. Manually add these as custom fields, matching their data types.
  
  
### **Step 3:** Recreate Forms & Surveys in HighLevel

# **Migrate Contacts**

  
Unlike HighLevel, Typeforms doesn't require email or phone for each form submission. You must only export form responses that have phone and email fields to migrate to HighLevel Contacts.
  
  
### **Step 1:** Export Form Responses from Typeform

* **Export Typeform Data:** Access their form in My Workspace, navigate to Results, and select Responses.
* **Download Data:** Use the checkbox to select all responses. Click the download icon at the top right to download all form responses in CSV format for backup.

### **Step 2:** Prepare CSV for HighLevel Import

* **Check Date Formats:** Ensure all date fields in the CSV are in the YYYY-MM-DD format. This is essential for compatibility with HighLevel.
* **Encode Special Characters:** Make sure the CSV file uses UTF-8 character encoding to properly handle special and accented characters.
* **Clean Up Data:** Remove any line breaks, emojis, and unnecessary special characters from the file. This step helps prevent import errors.
* **Recreate Custom Fields:** Log in to HighLevel and navigate to Contacts > Settings > Custom Fields. Add custom fields to store contact data in a similar way to how they were stored in Typeform.
  
  
### **Step 3:** Import Contacts into HighLevel

* **Log in to HighLevel:** Navigate to the Contacts section using the left-hand menu.
* **Start Import Process:** Click the Import Contacts button.
* **Upload CSV File:** Select and upload the prepared CSV file.
* **Map Fields:** HighLevel will prompt you to map the fields from the CSV file to the corresponding fields in HighLevel. For example, map “First Name” in the CSV to “First Name” in HighLevel.  
    
   * **Field Mapping Tip:** Ensure all required fields are correctly mapped. If a field in your CSV does not have a corresponding field in HighLevel, you may need to create a custom field in HighLevel before proceeding.
* **Assign Tags and Lists:** During the import process, you can assign contacts to specific lists and apply tags. Consider applying a tag that indicates the source of the contacts, such as “Typeform Import.”
* **Complete Import:** After mapping all fields and setting tags/lists, click Import. HighLevel will process the import, and the contacts will be added to your account.
  
  
### **Step 4:** Review Imported Data

* **Review:** Check that all data imported into HighLevel, including contacts and form submissions, is accurate and complete.
* **Cross-Check with Typeform Data:** Compare the data in HighLevel with the original Typeform data to ensure no discrepancies.

# **Migrate Automation and Follow-Ups**

  
Automation in Typeform can be built in-app or by using Slack, Zapier, or webhooks.
  
  
### **Step 1:** Review Existing Automations in TypeForm

* **Review any remaining automation sequences in Typeform:** Access settings by clicking the gear icon. If they cannot be created in the Form Builder, may be created in HighLevel workflows, like follow up messaging, integrations, and webhooks.
  
  
### **Step 2:** Recreate Automations in HighLevel

* **Set up triggers and actions:** Use HighLevel’s automation workflows to set up similar sequences that cannot be built inside form builder, such as sending follow-up emails or triggering CRM actions based on form responses.
* **Test Automations:** Ensure that each automation triggers correctly and performs as expected when forms are submitted.
