# **Migrate Users**

  
Calendly Supports multiple users in a Calendly Organization(think of this as an Agency level.) Each user gets their own Calendly account and individual Calendly page, along with event types you assign to their account.

  
Admins and Owners of Calendly organizations can download a list of organization members in their Calendly organization which shows the following for every member. This list will help us ensure the users are added to the HighLevel subaccount. 
  
  
### **Step 1:** Export a list of Calendly Users

* **Log in to Calendly:** At the top right corner of any Calendly page, select Account > Users. Select Export. A CSV file will be downloaded.
  
  
### **Step 2:** Add and Assign Users to the HighLevel Subaccount

* **Log in to HighLevel:** Go Agency Settings > Team. Verify users in Calendly are added and assigned to the HighLevel Subaccount.
* Use the \+ Add Employee to add missing users. Use the calendly export to determine the user's role.

### **Step 3:** Post-Migration Check

# **Migrate Calendars (Event Types)**

### **Step 1:** Document Event Types

* **List Event Types:** In Calendly, identify and document each event type you’ve created, including its name, duration, location, and associated settings.

* **Create New Appointment Type:** Select Create New Calendar to start setting up a new appointment type.
* **Configure Appointment Details:** Set the name, duration, location (Date-Specific Hours), and other settings such as buffer times, minimum notice, and daily limits. Add Team members to Calendars. This corresponds to the Event Type settings in Calendly.
* **Custom Fields:** If your Calendly event types collected additional information (e.g., questions or forms), [click here to learn how to recreate these as custom fields in HighLevel Forms.](https://help.gohighlevel.com/en/support/solutions/articles/155000003223)
  
  
### **Step 3:** Share Scheduling Links

* **Generate and Share Link:** After setting up each appointment type, generate the corresponding scheduling link in HighLevel. Share these links with your team or embed them in your website and emails, replacing the old Calendly links.
  
  
### **Step 4:** Post-Migration Check

* **Test Booking Process:** Ensure that the booking process works as expected by performing a test booking through the new HighLevel appointment link. Verify that all settings (e.g., buffer times, form questions, notifications, Zoom link) function correctly.

# **Migrate Workflows (Automations)**

  
Calendly workflows automate tasks such as sending reminder emails or follow-up messages. HighLevel offers similar automation capabilities through its Workflows feature.
  
  
### **Step 1:** Document Existing Workflows

* **Review Workflows in Calendly:** From your [Calendly home page](https://calendly.com/event%5Ftypes/user/me)[](https://calendly.com/event%5Ftypes/user/me)**[](https://calendly.com/event%5Ftypes/user/me)**, select [Workflows](https://calendly.com/app/workflows/user/me)[](https://calendly.com/app/workflows/user/me)**[](https://calendly.com/app/workflows/user/me)** from the navigation panel on the left-hand side. Document the workflows you have set up in Calendly, including triggers (e.g., event creation, event cancellation) and actions (e.g., send email, send SMS).
  
  
### **Step 2:** Recreate Workflows in HighLevel

* **Access Workflows:** In HighLevel, navigate to Automation > Workflows.
* **Create New Workflow:** Select Create New Workflow and set up the conditions and actions that match those documented from Calendly. Use HighLevel’s trigger options to start the workflow based on similar events (e.g., appointment booked, appointment canceled, appointment no show).
* **Customize Messages:** Customize any email or SMS messages that are part of the workflow, using HighLevel’s variables for personalization.
  
  
### **Step 3:** Post-Migration Check
