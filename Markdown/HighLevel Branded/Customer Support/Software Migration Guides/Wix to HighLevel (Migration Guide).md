# **Migrate Contacts**

  
When a lead submits a contact form, subscribes to a newsletter, makes a purchase, or engages with the site in other ways, Wix automatically adds them to the user's Contact List, including the information they provided.
  
  
### **Step 1:** Exporting Contacts from Wix

* **Log in to Wix**: Access your Contacts dashboard by logging into your Wix account.
* **Export Contacts:** Click the More Actions icon ![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155032356820/original/-oQzpkEEDnopFmKp_b73C_8sNYNRkBYhGg.png?1725558142) and click Export contacts. Select the option By Label to select a contact group, or select All Contacts.
* **Save the CSV:** Save the CSV file for future import into HighLevel.
  
  
### **Step 2:** Prepare CSV for HighLevel Import

* **Check Date Formats:** Ensure all date fields in the CSV are in the YYYY-MM-DD format. This is essential for compatibility with HighLevel.
* **Encode Special Characters:** Make sure the CSV file uses UTF-8 character encoding to properly handle special and accented characters.
* **Clean Up Data:** Remove any line breaks, emojis, and unnecessary special characters from the file. This step helps prevent import errors.
* **Recreate Custom Fields:** Log in to HighLevel and navigate to Contacts > Settings > Custom Fields. Add custom fields to store contact data in a similar way to how they were stored in Wix.
  
  
### **Step 3:** Import Contacts into HighLevel

* **Log in to HighLevel:** Navigate to the Contacts section using the left-hand menu.
* **Start Import Process:** Click the Import Contacts button.
* **Upload CSV File:** Select and upload the prepared CSV file.
* **Map Fields:** HighLevel will prompt you to map the fields from the CSV file to the corresponding fields in HighLevel. For example, map “First Name” in the CSV to “First Name” in HighLevel.
* **Assign Tags and Lists:** During the import process, you can assign contacts to specific lists and apply tags. Consider applying a tag that indicates the source of the contacts, such as “Imported from Wix.”
* **Complete Import:** After mapping all fields and setting tags/lists, click Import. HighLevel will process the import, and the contacts will be added to your account.
  
  
**Field Mapping Tip:** Ensure all required fields are correctly mapped. If a field in your CSV does not have a corresponding field in HighLevel, you may need to create a custom field in HighLevel before proceeding.

# **Recreate Pipelines (Wix Workflows)**

  
A Wix Workflow is a board that displays all of the steps of a project so you can easily keep track of contact cards in every column. Wix workflows cannot be exported and must be recreated in HighLevel Pipelines & Opportunities.
  
  
**IMPORTANT:** When migrating pipelines, the naming conventions are slightly different.  
  
**Workflow** (Wix)  ➡️  **Pipeline** (HighLevel)  
**Column** (Wix)  ➡️  **Pipeline Stage** (HighLevel)  
**Cards** (Wix)  ➡️  **Opportunity Cards** (HighLevel)
  
  
### **Step 1:** View Wix Workflows(Pipelines)

* **Log in to Wix:** Go to Workflows in your site's dashboard. View All Pipelines and their columns.
  
  
### **Step 2:** Recreate Pipelines in HighLevel

* **Log in to HighLevel:** Go to Opportunities on the left sidebar. Select Pipelines.
* **Add Pipelines:** Click Add Pipeline. Recreate the pipelines stages to match the stages in Wix.

# **Migrate Forms and Submission Data**

  
Users can embed customizable Wix Forms directly to their site for visitors to fill out (e.g. Contact forms or Get a Quote forms) or share standalone forms with unique URL. By default, when someone submits a form, an email is automatically sent to the site owner notifying them about the submission.

* **Configure Form Actions:** Set up automated actions in HighLevel, such as form notifications or conditional logic in forms, to replicate the functionality from Wix.

# **Recreate Websites and Connect Domains**

Wix does not offer direct export options for full website content. In order for Wix sites to work properly, it needs to be hosted and operated on Wix's servers. Therefore, you will need to manually copy text, images, and other media files to rebuild sites and online stores in HighLevel.
  
  
### **Step 1:** Export Content from Wix

* **Log in to Wix:** Begin by logging into your Wix account and accessing your Wix dashboard.
* **Export Website Content:** Download images, videos, and documents from the Wix Media Manager to ensure you have all the necessary content for your migration.
* **Save HTML/CSS:** If you have used custom code on your Wix site, copy the HTML, CSS, and any custom scripts to preserve the design and functionality of your website.
  
  
### **Step 2:** Rebuild Your Website in HighLevel

* **Log in to HighLevel:** Access your HighLevel account and navigate to Sites > Funnels or Sites > Websites, depending on your website’s structure.
* **Rebuild Pages:** Manually recreate each page by pasting the copied content and re-uploading media files into HighLevel. Utilize HighLevel’s drag-and-drop editor to design your pages and add forms similarly to your Wix site.
* **Add Custom Code:** If you used custom HTML/CSS in Wix, you can add this code to the relevant sections in HighLevel to maintain the original functionality and design.
  
  
### **Step 3:** Disconnect your Domain from Wix

* Log in to Wix
* Go to the Domains page.
* Click the Show More icon ![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155032356814/original/n0M0340akWZBxK7sbaydJwVPx8CplLxKXA.png?1725558141) next to the relevant domain and select Unassign from This Site.
