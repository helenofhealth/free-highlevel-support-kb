# How to Manage Your Billing

**Did you know** you can see every single charge to your account as well as manage your subscription, wallet amounts, and more from within your HighLevel App? Just log into your HighLevel desktop App and navigate to your Company Billing Settings (Agency View > Billing). We even break down charges by Sub-Account, it's a critical tool when discussing or reviewing HighLevel charges or pricing.

# HighLevel Subscription Plans

At the core of the HighLevel service is our subscription plans which are in three tiers. Starter, Unlimited, and Agency Pro. Each plan level unlocks additional features to help Level Up your business. Before you can utilize the additional services shown below, you must have an active subscription and account with us.

  
![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155011791220/original/svYux4lMwR6HdGZ-M8ciQtWuPC8W_kJL4g.png?1698957582)

\*Subject to change. We are always coming out with new features or adjusting our offerings to best serve you.

  
If you have a question about which features work with which plan or you're interested in upgrading to another plan, you can schedule a call with our [Account Management Team](https://speakwith.us/consult).

# Additional Services

In addition to your HighLevel Subscription plan, you can decide to opt into additional HighLevel services which will further unlock the true power of HighLevel. For example, instead of having to build and maintain your own phone system (not an easy task), you can opt into our LC Phone System. We've done all of the hard work for you. 

  
When you opt into any of these services, you begin preloading a "Wallet." Which is required in order to use many of our additional services.

  
## **What is an Agency Wallet?**

When you opt into any of these additional services outlined below (such as LC Phone, Email, or AI), you begin an "Agency Wallet." Agency Wallets hold credits that are deducted from when you use an Additional Service listed below (such as LC Phone, Email, or AI). To load credits into your wallet, HighLevel charges your Agency card on file. Wallet charges occur when wallet balances drop below a minimum amount. 

  
Minimum wallet amount thresholds and wallet recharge amounts can be adjusted anytime from within your [Agency Level Billing > Wallet & Transitions Tab](https://app.gohighlevel.com/settings/billing?tab=wallet%5Ftransactions). 

  
![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155022484835/original/un7XOtgz05bjT6opvTufOHPtZeBR8oa7og.jpg?1709846143)

  
**Why do we use a "Wallet"?**

Unlike other companies, HighLevel only charges you for the amount you use. Most companies will charge you based on a number of SMS or Emails, like say 500 SMS per month for $40/mo. But what if you don't send any SMS or only 100 SMS? You just paid for the SMS you did use.

  
This is why we use a Wallet and charge for based on your usage only. You pay low prices and only for what you use.

## **Workflow Premium Triggers and Actions**

  
**What are Premium Triggers & Actions?**

Workflows are made up of triggers (1) and actions (2); initiate the workflow with one or more triggers, then execute one or more actions. All triggers and actions have unlimited executions. 

  
![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155036990252/original/4IwzYO1yGkAfcGl2ikgU9HM9uuBkkIeLew.png?1732203748)

  
**Premium Triggers & Actions Pricing**

Some triggers and actions are "premium" (3), meaning their execution has a small usage cost of $0.01 per execution (1/4th the cost of the Zapier base plan). Your Agency is not charged for free triggers and actions. Your Agency is charged for premium triggers and actions in all subaccounts beneath your Agency account. 

  
Your Agency can also rebill the cost of premium triggers and actions to offset the cost or to earn a profit margin you set.

  
Some premium Workflow actions—such as ChatGPT—have different pricing. GPT-3.5 Turbo costs $0.015 per execution, and GPT-4 Turbo costs $0.03 per execution, after the first 100 free executions per month. [Click here for more info on how to rebill Workflow AI](https://help.gohighlevel.com/en/support/solutions/articles/155000000169).

## **Workflow Pro Plan**

**What is Workflow Pro Plan?**

The Workflow Pro Plan is a subscription bundle of prepaid premium trigger and actions executions. A subaccount can subscribe to get 10,000 executions at a predictable fixed price.

  
**Workflow Pro Plan Pricing**

The Workflow Pro Plan is 10,000 Premium Triggers & Actions for $10/mo. After 10,000 executions in a month each execution is $0.01/execution (the normal price). If you use all 10,000 executions it is $0.001/execution. The normal $0.01 price is already 75% cheaper than Zapier so with the Workflow Pro Plan the first 10,000 executions are 97% cheaper than Zapier.

  
You can also resell the Workflow Pro Plan to your clients when your Agency is on the $497/mo plan.

  
Note: Workflow Pro does not include ChatGPT or Workflow AI. Those executions are still billed pay-as-you-go.

All plans can use the free triggers and actions at no additional cost, and the premium triggers and actions at $0.01/execution. Unlimited and Pro plans can also automatically rebill subaccounts for per use costs of premium triggers and actions.

## **Ad Manager**

  
**What is Ad Manager?**

Ad Manager is an easy, simple to use platform to create, manage and analyze paid ads ideal to grown your business by increasing its visibility and reach to the masses. Using Facebook Ads for you, Ad Manager can generate new leads with simple ad creation and seamless syncing of leads or increase traffic on your website. It is an easy three step ad campaign creation process, all without leaving Ad Manager, right from connecting your Facebook account to publishing an ad campaign.

  
**Ad Manager Pricing**

The first step to using Ad Manager is to select a plan at the Agency level.

* Default: 10% of the ad budget after the Agency's commission is subtracted. Perfect if you are not already using Meta Business Manager (and don't plan to). Example: Client sets $800/mo budget, Agency charges 10% ($80) leaving $720, HighLevel charges 10% ($72) leaving $648 for ads.
* Connect-your-own Meta Business: The Agency pays a flat $97/month (or $970/year) to HighLevel for unlimited campaigns in unlimited sub-accounts. Then the Agency sets a flat monthly price for Client sub-accounts to pay in order to use Ad Manager or include it as part of your SaaS plan.

  
The Default plan creates a new child account under HighLevel's Meta Business manager which you will not have access to. Once this child account is created you will not be able to connect the same Facebook account to a different location.
  
  
Once an Agency selects an Ad Manager plan it cannot be changed.

# FAQs

The following are some helpful Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs).

  
## What does “Rebilling” mean?

Rebilling is when an Agency Owner/Admin enables the rebilling feature to recover the cost of running that Sub-Account Service. For example: HighLevel charges Agency Owners for every SMS sent via our LeadConnector (LC) Phone System. However, the client can then set up rebilling to charge the client this amount to their client to recover the cost incurred by their client. This is done at the Sub-Account Levels.

  
The Agency Owner is always charged by HighLevel for the same amount as our pricing per service and usage. However, the Agency Owner can rebill the client to recover costs. In addition, on the $497 plan, you can “mark up” the amount rebilled to charge the Sub-Account a larger amount than the Agency will pay. This can be done in the Sub-Account Settings or in the SaaS Configurator.

## What does “Re-sell” or “Reselling” mean?

Similar to rebilling, reselling is offering one of our reselling services to a Sub-Account. The following services can be resold: 

* Workflow Pro Plan
* Branded Client Portal App
* AI Employee Unlimited Plan
* Yext Online Listings
* WordPress Hosting
* WhatsApp
* Dedicated IP for Email Sending
* Ad Manager

  
The settings for these services can be found in the Agency View > Reselling (<https://app.gohighlevel.com/reselling>) 

  
Agency owners will be charged the “HighLevel Price” by HighLevel for each Sub-Account that a feature is enabled for. However, they will be able to recover the cost, if they so choose, by enabling “re-sell” in-app. They can choose to offer it at the HighLevel Price or a higher re-sell price, allowing a profit to be generated.

## What is an SMS Segment?

A segment is a portion of an SMS message used by carriers to send and calculate costs. Each SMS is divided into segments based on its length, with longer messages requiring multiple segments. Since charges are based on the number of segments, longer messages cost more. See [What the Heck is a Segment by Twilio](https://www.twilio.com/blog/what-the-heck-is-a-segment-html) for a more in-depth explanation.

  
## Am I Charged for Unanswered Calls?

If you call someone and they do not pick up and you do not leave a voicemail - you are generally not charged for this call. Some restrictions may apply based on the outcome of the call and the type of call you are attempting.
