# **What are Auto Recharge & Smart Adjustment?**

  
Auto Recharge adds funds to your HighLevel wallet whenever the balance falls under a limit you decide. Smart Adjustment is an adaptive tier system that , based on recent recharge frequency , raises your Auto Recharge amount to ensure fewer funding interruptions as your volume scales.

## **Auto Recharge** 

  
Auto Recharge uses two simple fields: 

  
1. **Recharge Amount** – The dollar amount added to your wallet each time Auto Recharge triggers.
2. **Threshold Balance** – The wallet balance that triggers the recharge once it’s reached or passed.

  
**Example**: If Recharge Amount = $50 and Threshold Balance = $25, then when your wallet balance hits $24.99, HighLevel instantly charges your saved payment method $50 and deposits it in your wallet.

## **Smart Adjustment**

  
Smart Adjustment monitors how often Auto Recharge fires. When the same recharge amount triggers more than **three times within any seven‑day window**, HighLevel moves you to the next preset tier (e.g., from $200 → $500). 

  
**Why it matters:** As your sending volume grows, larger recharges mean fewer credit‑card holds and fewer risk‑flag reviews by card issuers.

## **Frequently Asked Questions** 

  
**Q: How does HighLevel determine the next tier when Smart Adjustment upgrades?**

It moves to the very next predefined recharge tier (e.g., $200 → $500 → $1,000). Custom amounts are not skipped.

  
**Q:** **Will I receive email notifications when Auto Recharge or Smart Adjustment occurs?**

Yes. Billing notification emails are sent to agency owner admins by default.

  
**Q: Can I change the Threshold Balance without affecting Smart Adjustment history?**

Yes. Adjusting the threshold does not reset your usage count. The three‑in‑seven‑days rule still applies.

  
**Q: What happens if my saved payment method fails?**

HighLevel will retry the charge up to three times over 24 hours and email you each attempt. Service pauses after final failure.
