# **How to Access 24/7 Support**

At any time of the day or night, seven days a week, you can begin a new LIVE chat with one of our HighLevel Support Agents! To access your support options, select the blue question mark in the top right corner of the HighLevel Application **(Available on Desktop only)**. From here, you can choose the support option that best fits your schedule or needs.

HighLevel Support agents are unable to make changes to an agency account without the consent of a validated Agency Admin or Agency User. If you do not have access to the Agency view, you must reach out to your Agency Admin.

## **Zoom Support Calls**

If you need face-to-face support from our team, you can quickly and easily join our Zoom support rooms and chat with a support agent who will answer your questions and guide you through your support inquiries in person!

  
Once you request a Zoom call, you will be added to a queue where you will wait for the next available support agent. This agent will help you troubleshoot the issue you're experiencing live on Zoom and do their best to resolve the issue right then and there.

Our agents will gather as much information as they can about the issue you're having, and do their best to help you solve the problem right then and there.

  
If the issue cannot be solved, the agents will escalate the issue to a team that may be better suited to help, and create a support ticket for your issue so that you can maintain communication with our support staff while the issue is being addressed.

## **Support Ticketing via Email**

  
**IMPORTANT:** In order to receive email support from our team, you will need to open a support ticket. HighLevel does NOT have a general support email address

  
If you are too busy to speak to our team on a Zoom call or live chat, you can always just create a support ticket immediately and communicate back and forth with our support staff via email at your earliest convenience.

  
We would like to ask that you respond as soon as possible to any email coming from our team so that we can get your support issue resolved as fast as we can. You're experience in HighLevel is our #1 priority, so we want to make sure any issue you're having are resolved fast so you can get back to growing your business!

  
## **What's Included in a Support Ticket?**

  
**1\. Why You're Receiveing The Ticket Email**

In this initial email, you will see a few possibilities as to why you're chat was converted into a support ticket.

  
**These usually include:**

* Our support team provided you with a troubleshooting step or resolution but you did not confirm if that step resolved the issue.
* Our support team asked you for additional information and did not receive it.

  
**2\. Next Steps**

We outline what steps you can take to further investigate the support issue and hopefully resolve it. 

  
**3\. Conversation History**

# **Troubleshooting & FAQ's**

  
Below you will find some frequently asked questions and process to help you troubleshoot issues surrounding customer support. If there is a question that you need answered, and you don't see it below, please make sure to let our support staff know, or you can send us feedback on this article and ask us to add the question to the article.
  
  
**Q: Does HighLevel have a support email address?**

No, we do not have a support email. The main reason is because our support flow is very detailed so that we can properly identify the issue the user is experiencing, and create a ticket in our support software that includes all the information needed for our support agents to help resolve the issue.

  
If we had a general support email address, then all emails sent to that address would create support tickets, and they may not include the proper information needed to give our support staff the best chance to help resolve the issue.
  
  
**Q: How to Contact Support if I can't Login to HighLevel?**

If you are having trouble logging into your HighLevel application, and you need to get support outside of the application, you have the following options to contact HighLevel support:

1. **Phone Support:** Call this number to reach our support if you're having trouble loggin in **[(+1 (888) 732-4197)](tel:+18887324197)**
2. **Website Chat Widget:** You can also reach out support staff if you navigate to our main website and use our website chat widget. Make sure to tell our team that you are having trouble logging in, and that you need help from support.
3. **Email Support:** Submit a ticket [using this form](https://link.gohighlevel.com/widget/form/aujwIzqADXoECxSATYeI) and our team will get on it right away.

  
**IMPORTANT:** Have your Agency information ready so our team can verify your identity and make sure you are an agency admin or account owner.
  
  
**Q: I'm not seeing the Blue Question Mark button in my dashboard**

The blue question mark button and its features are only visible to users logged in as a **"Agency Admin"** or "**Agency User"**.
