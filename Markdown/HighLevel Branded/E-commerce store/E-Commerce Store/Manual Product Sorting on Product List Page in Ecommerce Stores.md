Manual Product Sorting is a HighLevel Ecommerce Store feature that allows store owners to set a custom display order for products on the Product List Page. By assigning a display priority to each product, you can highlight bestsellers, new arrivals, or promotional items, ensuring they are seen first by your customers. This hands-on approach to product arrangement enhances your store’s visual appeal and sales strategy.
