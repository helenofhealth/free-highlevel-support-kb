# A. Making Shipping Details Hidden, Optional or Mandatory

  
This section provides a step-by-step guide to help store owners customize the **Shipping Details** section on their Ecommerce store's checkout page by making fields **Hidden**, **Optional**, or **Mandatory**.

---

## Why Customize Shipping Details in Checkout?

Customizing the Shipping Details section allows you to:

* Enable faster checkouts by asking for only relevant information.
* Simplify the customer experience to improve conversion rates.
* Meet the specific requirements for shipping rate calculations or live rates integration with platforms like **Shippo**.

---

## Step-by-Step Guide

### 1\. Access the Checkout Page Editor

1. Go to your **Sites > Stores > Select your Store**.
2. Select Edit the **Checkout Page** for editing.

### 2\. Select the Checkout Element

1. Click on the **Checkout element** within the page editor.
2. This will open the settings menu on the right side of the screen.

### 3\. Navigate to the Advanced Settings

1. In the settings menu, locate and click on the **Advanced Section**.
2. Look for the **Form Options** subsection.

### 4\. Customize the Fields

1. In the **Form Options**, you’ll see a list of fields under the Shipping Details section:  
   * Phone Number  
   * Address  
   * Country/State  
   * City  
   * Zip/Postal Code
2. For each field, you can choose its status from the dropdown menu:

## Key Considerations

### 1\. Impact on Shipping Rates

* Some shipping carriers calculate rates based on specific fields like **Address**, **City**, and **Zip/Postal Code**. Ensure all necessary fields are retained as **Mandatory** if you rely on accurate shipping rate calculations.

### 2\. Live Rates Compatibility

* If you’re using multi-carrier platforms like **Shippo**, all fields need to be completed by customers to retrieve live shipping rates.

### 3\. Faster Checkout Process

* Reducing the number of mandatory fields can streamline the checkout experience for your customers, encouraging higher conversion rates.

### Q2: What happens if I hide a field?
