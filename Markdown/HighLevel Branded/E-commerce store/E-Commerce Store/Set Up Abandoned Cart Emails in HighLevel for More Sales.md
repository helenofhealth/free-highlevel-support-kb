# **What is Automatic Abandoned Cart Checkout Email?**

  
A**utomatic abandoned checkout email** is triggered when a customer adds items to their shopping cart, begins the checkout process, enters their email address, but doesn’t complete the purchase. The system detects this incomplete action and automatically sends a follow-up email to encourage the customer to return and finish the checkout.

  
This feature is enabled **by default** and operates silently in the background, helping store owners **recover abandoned revenue** without any manual effort.

## **Key Benefits of Abandoned Checkout Emails**

  
* **Sales Recovery:** Convert lost opportunities into sales by re-engaging customers who dropped off.

  
* **Fully Automated:** Once enabled, the system tracks and sends emails without any manual setup.

  
* **Customizable Messaging:** Tailor the email content to match your brand voice and cart value.

  
* **Dynamic Product Display:** Showcase the exact products left in the cart, increasing emotional reattachment.

## **Customizing the Abandoned Checkout Email**

  
To maximize the impact of your follow-up emails, customize both **the design** and **the content**. Here are two key ways to do this:

  
### **Override the Default Email Template**

  
HighLevel includes a basic abandoned checkout email, but you can make yours more engaging with a custom template.

  
### **Open Email Templates**

  
Navigate to **Marketing → Emails → Templates** to create or edit the email that will be used for abandoned checkout reminders. This is where you can design a branded, personalized message using the Email Builder.

### **Use the Templates Tab**

  
Click on the **Templates** tab within Email Marketing to view all your saved email designs. This is where you’ll select or create the template used for your abandoned cart notification.

### **Create or Select a Template**

  
Click the **\+ New** button to build a fresh email template, or choose an existing one from the list by clicking its name. These templates can be linked to your abandoned cart notification to deliver a customized message.

###   

### **Add Custom Values**

  
Click the **custom value icon** in the email editor toolbar to insert eCommerce fields like {{ ecom\_checkout\_page\_url }}. This allows the email to link directly to the customer’s abandoned cart or product list.

### **Add Dynamic Cart Display with Shopping Cart Element**

  
Make your emails more personalized by displaying the **exact items left in the cart** — including product images, names, prices, and quantities.

  
**How to do it:**

* In the email builder, locate the **Shopping Cart** element under eCommerce elements
* Drag and drop it into your email layout
* The element auto-populates with cart contents (if the customer reached the checkout page)

### **Use Shopping Cart Element**

  
Drag the **Shopping Cart** element into your email layout to automatically display the customer’s abandoned products. This adds a personalized, visual touch by showing item names, prices, and quantities directly in the email.

> ? _Note:_ This works only if the system has captured the cart data — typically when the user reaches the checkout page and provides an email address.
