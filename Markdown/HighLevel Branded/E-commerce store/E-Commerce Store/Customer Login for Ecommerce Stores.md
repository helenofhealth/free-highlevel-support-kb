## **What is Customer Login?**

  
The Customer Login feature enables a dedicated login portal for your ecommerce store. When enabled, a login button appears in the store’s navigation menu. After logging in, customers gain access to a personalized dropdown menu that includes their order history and the option to log out — all built seamlessly into your store’s UI.

  
## **Key Benefits of Customer Login**

  
Customer Login adds both functionality and professionalism to your store experience. It allows customers to engage more confidently with your brand while maintaining full access to their order data.

* Seamless login directly from the storefront — no redirects needed
* Post-login dropdown provides quick access to customer-specific actions
* Customizable login icon color and navigation labels
* Toggle to open login in a new or current browser tab
* Add custom navigation menu items with redirect options
* Requires verified domain for secure login functionality

  
## **How to Enable Customer Login**

  
Follow these steps to enable and customize Customer Login for your ecommerce store:

1. **Open the Store Builder** from your dashboard.
2. Navigate to your store page and click on the **Navigation Menu**.
3. Go to:  
   * **General Settings > Customer Login**  
   * Turn ON the **Enable Customer Login** toggle.
4. In the same settings area, scroll to the **Menu Items Dropdown** section to:  
   * Add new menu items  
   * Define each item’s **redirect URL**  
   * Choose whether the link should open in a **new tab** or the same window
5. Verify that your **store domain is added and verified**.  
   * Make sure the domain is linked to an existing store page. Without this, the login button will not work properly.

  
> ⚠️ **Note**: If the toggle is OFF, the login button will not appear in your store’s navigation. A valid domain must be connected and verified for the login feature to work.

  
## **Login Button in Store Navigation**

  
The login button is a new, customizable feature in the store’s top navigation. This provides customers with immediate access to their accounts without navigating away from your storefront.

  
### **Login Button Features:**

* **Enable/Disable Toggle** – Show or hide the login button
* **Icon Color Customization** – Match your brand theme
* **Add More Menu Items** – Provide quick access to other useful pages
* **Open in New Tab** – Let visitors choose how they want links to open

  
## **Customer Dropdown Menu (Post Login)**

  
Once a customer logs in, their profile icon will activate a dropdown menu that contains essential actions.

  
### **Dropdown Options:**

* **Orders** – View a full list of past orders
* **Logout** – Sign out of the customer account

  
This clean, intuitive interface allows customers to stay in control of their shopping experience with minimal effort.
