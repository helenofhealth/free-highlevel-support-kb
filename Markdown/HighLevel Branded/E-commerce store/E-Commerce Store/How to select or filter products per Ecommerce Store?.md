## **Overview**

The _Product Selection per Store_ feature enables store owners to control which products are visible in specific stores within a sub-account. This enhancement provides better inventory management, allowing businesses to tailor their product offerings for different stores.

  
## **Feature Breakdown**

### **1\. "Include in Online Store" Toggle for Products**

This toggle determines whether a product is available for store selection.

* **Enabled**: The product will be available for inclusion or exclusion in the _Products_ section across all stores.
* **Disabled**: The product will not appear in the _Stores â†’ Products_ section for any store.

### **2\. Product Listing Behavior**

* When a new store is created, all products with the "Include in Online Store" toggle enabled will be automatically listed.
* Newly created products will be listed in all stores by default if the toggle is enabled.

### **3\. Bulk Actions for Product Visibility**

* Store owners can select multiple products and apply bulk inclusion or exclusion across stores.
* If a bulk action is performed, it only applies to products that do not already match the selected state.

### **4\. Search & Filter Options**

To enhance product management, users can:

* Search products by **Product Name**.
* Filter products by **Collections** to quickly find relevant items.

## **Key Considerations**

* Products with the "Include in Online Store" toggle disabled will not be available for store selection.
* When a new store is created, only products with "Include in Online Store" enabled will be available.
* Newly created stores inherit product visibility based on the **Include in Online Store** setting.
* Store owners can edit product details directly by selecting a product from the _Products_ section.
