## What is the Billing Address Feature?

The Billing Address feature allows Ecommerce store owners to collect a separate billing address from customers during checkout. It adds a new section to the Checkout Page and stores the billing information alongside shipping details across multiple HighLevel components such as Contacts, CAS, Order Confirmation Emails, and more.

## Key Benefits of the Billing Address Feature

This section highlights the main reasons why store owners should consider enabling this feature.

* Capture billing information separately from shipping for compliance or invoicing needs.
* Improve clarity and accuracy of order data.
* Maintain better customer records with dual address support in the Contacts tab.
* Display billing address in CAS and packing slips for streamlined post-order processing.
* Customize text labels to match your store’s tone and customer language.
* Enable/disable the feature per location to suit store-specific needs.

## How To Enable the Billing Address Feature

Learn how to activate the Billing Address feature and customize the checkout flow.

1. Open the Store Builder and navigate to your Checkout Page.
2. Click on the Checkout Element to access its settings.
3. Scroll to the Advanced section and locate Form Options.
4. Toggle “Enable Billing Address” ON.
5. Go to the General section to customize:  
    
   * Billing Address Headline Text (e.g., “Billing Information”)  
   * Billing Address Checkbox Text (e.g., “Same as Shipping Address”)
6. Click Save and Publish your changes.

## Checkout Page Structure Update

Understanding how the billing address fits into the new checkout layout is key to planning a smooth customer experience.

Once enabled, your checkout form will follow this structure:

1. Contact Details
2. Shipping Details
3. Billing Details (New Section)
4. Notes
5. Shipping Options
6. Payment Methods

Customers will see a checkbox labeled “Same as Shipping Address”, which is checked by default to minimize extra input unless a different billing address is needed.

## How the Billing Address Appears Across the Platform

Explore how the billing address data integrates across various HighLevel touchpoints after a customer submits an order.

* Order Details Page: Displays billing address under the “Customer Info” section, separate from the shipping address.
* Customer Access Center (CAS): Billing address is included in the customer’s Order Details view.
* Contacts: Both shipping and billing addresses are stored under the Ecommerce store contact record.
* Packing Slips & Thank You Pages: Both addresses appear for improved order processing and customer transparency.
* Order Confirmation Emails: Automatically include the billing address when filled.
