## **Frequently Asked Questions**

  
**Q: Can I deliver digital products if the purchase is made through a funnel?**

Digital product delivery via secure links and the Customer Access Center is only supported for purchases made through HighLevel’s native E-Commerce store. For funnel purchases, you can use a workaround by creating a workflow with the **Form Submitted** trigger and adding an **Email** step to manually send the digital product link to the customer. While this doesn’t use the Customer Access Center, it ensures timely delivery of the product via email.
