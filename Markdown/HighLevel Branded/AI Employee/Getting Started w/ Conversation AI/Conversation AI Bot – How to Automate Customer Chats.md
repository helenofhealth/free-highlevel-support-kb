3. **Auto-Pilot:** The bot automatically responds to a contact on behalf of the business.

## **Configuring Bot's Intent**

  
Currently, there are 2 intents supported by the bot:

  
1. **General Support or Q/A:** Provides information to the contact's queries based on the training information
2. **Appointment Booking:** Ask a few questions (customizable) and then book an appointment on the calendar.  
Note: If an appointment for a contact is already booked ie in the Active/Confirmer state, the intent will dynamically switch to General support for that contact till the appointment is either completed or cancelled

## **Testing the Bot (Bot Trial)**

  
* The Conversation AI bot is FREE to test in the "Bot Trial" tab of your Conversation AI Sub-account settings page.
* The intent to test can be selected from the dropdown and the bot will respond to you the same way it will respond to a contact
* Feedback can be provided by using the "Thumbs Up and Down" under each bot's response to fine-tune and add FaQs to be trained

## **Workflow X Conversation AI**

  
Utilize the power of your bot training within workflows by using the Conversation AI Action following:

  
1. Customization your entire prompt
2. Conditional movement of the contact within the workflow
3. Ask specific questions and create branches based on the contact's reply

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

  
**Q: Can I control how many messages the bot sends before it stops or hands off to an agent?**

Yes. In the Advanced Settings section, you can define the maximum message count before the bot stops responding or transfers the conversation to a human agent.

  
**Q: Can I turn on the AI for just one channel while turning it off for the others?**

Yes. GoHighLevel supports channel-specific bot control. You can assign or disable the bot per communication channel from within each channel’s settings or in the multi-bot view.

  
**Q: How do I add the AI chatbot to my website?**

Once you’ve built your Conversation AI Bot and added “Web Chat” as a supported channel, the AI functionality will automatically be included when you install the chat widget on your HighLevel funnel/website.
