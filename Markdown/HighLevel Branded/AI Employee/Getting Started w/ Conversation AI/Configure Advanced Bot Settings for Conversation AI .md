# **Advanced Settings Overview**

  
Advanced settings in Conversation AI give you control over your bot’s behavior. By configuring these options, you can tailor the bot’s responses to meet your business’s unique needs while maintaining an optimal customer experience.

  
* **Wait Time Before Responding:** Adjust the delay for responses to create a natural flow.
* **Maximum Message Limit:** Set the cap for the number of bot messages per interaction.
* **Send Bot to Sleep:** Temporarily disable the bot during manual interventions or workflows.

---

## **Business Name**

  
The bot automatically fetches your business name from your account settings. This ensures consistent branding in all conversations without manual input.
  
  
**Example Use Case**

* If your business name is "Tech Solutions," the bot will include this name in interactions, maintaining a professional and personalized tone.

## **Wait Time Before Responding**

  
Configure the delay before the bot replies to create a more natural conversational flow. This setting gives customers time to respond without feeling rushed.
  
  
#### **Recommended Settings**

* Most businesses find that a wait time of **5-20 seconds** works well.
* Consider customer expectations and industry norms when setting delays.

## **Maximum Message Limit**

  
This setting controls the maximum number of bot messages per interaction. If the limit is reached, the conversation can be reset to allow continued interaction.
  
  
**Resetting Maximum Message Limit**

  
Marking a conversation as "read" resets the message limit, giving the bot 10 more messages to send in that conversation.

  
* **For Example:** If you have a message limit set to 10 messages, the Conversation AI bot will stop sending messages once it sends its 10th message in any given conversation. Marking the conversation as "read" will reset that limit, giving the bot 10 more messages to send in any conversation it's reached it's limit in.

## **Send Bot to Sleep**

  
The **Send Bot to Sleep** feature temporarily disables the bot during manual interventions or workflow-initiated actions. This ensures that the bot doesn’t interrupt ongoing conversations.
  
  
#### **Scenarios for Using Sleep Mode:**

* A live agent is actively responding to a customer.
* A workflow is executing a process that requires uninterrupted communication.
