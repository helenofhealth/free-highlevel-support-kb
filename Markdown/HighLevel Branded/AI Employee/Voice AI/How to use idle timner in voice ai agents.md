## **Overview**

  
We’ve added the Idle Reminder Timer in every agent’s **Advanced Settings**, letting you configure how long (1–20 sec, default 8 sec) the agent waits before issuing a natural re-engagement prompt.

  
## **What is the Idle Timer Reminder?**

  
## The Idle Reminder Timer is a configurable delay that determines how long the agent waits during silence before speaking a natural reminder message to re-engage the caller. Helps with:

1. Proactive Engagement: Keeps callers from going silent, reducing dead air.
2. Improved Completion: Steers conversations back on track and boosting success rates.
3. Better UX: Agents sound natural when prompting, enhancing customer experience.

  
## **What's new?**

  
1. **Configurable Delay:** Set the idle reminder between 1 and 20 seconds in **Agent Page → Advanced Settings**(default: 8 sec).
2. **Auto‑Hangup:** Calls end automatically if the user remains silent for over 15 seconds after the reminder.
