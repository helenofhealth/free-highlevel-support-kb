**Overview**

  
The **Action Builder** for Voice AI has been completely redesigned to offer a cleaner, faster, and more intuitive experience. This update introduces a card-based layout, tabbed structure, and streamlined workflows, making it significantly easier to create, manage, and review what your agent does both during and after a call.
  
  
To enable this feature: Go to **Settings > Labs > Enable "Voice AI - Separate During and Post Call Actions"**

## **What’s New**

1. **Card-Based Interface**  
Actions now appear as individual cards. You can easily scan, sort, and organize actions with improved visual clarity.

2. **Tabbed Layout**  
The actions are now split into **During the Call** and **After the Call** sections. Each tab displays the total number of actions configured.
3. **Streamlined Creation Flow**  
A bold and easy-to-access **“New Action”** button encourages quick and structured action creation.

4. **Individual Action Modals**  
Every action type opens in a dedicated modal, eliminating the need to switch tabs or scroll through long forms.
5. **Quick Delete Option**  
You can now delete actions directly from the action card menu, no need to open the editor.

## Key Improvements

1. **Improved Visual Hierarchy**  
Action types are now easier to distinguish thanks to better labels and grouped layouts.
2. **Simplified Editing & Deletion**  
Edit or remove actions in fewer clicks — right from the action card.
3. **Built-In Constraints & Smart Guidance**  
   * **Visual counters** show you how many of each action type you're using.  
   * **Tooltips and inline guidance** prevent misconfiguration:  
         * Max **15 total actions** during a call  
         * Only **1 appointment booking action** allowed  
         * Up to **25 contact field update actions** after a call
