## **Overview**

We’ve enhanced post-call email notifications to give you full control over who receives them. Previously, notifications were limited to admins and users could only add one additional recipient. Now it’s no longer restricted to admins or a single recipient.

  
## **Why It Matters**

* **Personalization:** Notify only the people who need to know.
* **Reduced Noise:** Avoid pinging all admins with unwanted emails.
* **Improved Usability:** Easily configure multiple recipients.

  
## **What’s New?**

1. **Flexible Selection:** Choose one or more recipient types instead of just one.
2. **Admin Opt‑Out:** Notifications no longer default to all admins.
3. **Recipient Categories:**  
   * All Admins  
   * All Users  
   * Contact’s Assigned User  
   * Specific Users  
   * Custom Email
4. **UI Update:** New multi‑select controls in the **Agent Goals** tab.

  
## **How It Works**

1. Go to the **Create or Update Agent** flow in Voice AI.
2. Navigate to the **Agent Goals** tab.
3. Toggle on **Receive Email Notification Post Call Completion**.
4. Select one or more recipient types (All Admins, All Users, Contact’s Assigned User, Specific Users, or Custom Email).
5. If **Specific Users** is selected, choose users from the dropdown list.
6. If **Custom Email** is selected, enter the desired email address.
7. Click **Save** to apply your notification settings.
