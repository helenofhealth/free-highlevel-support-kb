# **What is Voice-AI Knowledge Base Integration?**

  
Voice-AI Knowledge Base Integration allows you to assign a specific knowledge base to each Voice-AI agent in HighLevel. When a user’s spoken input matches a configured trigger prompt, the agent automatically searches the attached knowledge base and delivers the most relevant answer. This ensures your voice agents provide intelligent, up-to-date responses tailored to your business needs.

## **Key Benefits of Voice-AI Knowledge Base Integration**

  
Unlock the full potential of your Voice-AI agents with these powerful advantages:

* **Personalized Agent Responses:** Assign unique knowledge bases to each agent, ensuring responses are relevant to the agent’s domain or purpose.
* **Trigger-Based Activation:** Use custom prompts to control exactly when the knowledge base is queried, aligning responses with user intent.
* **Real-Time, Dynamic Answers:** Voice agents analyze user queries and fetch precise answers from the knowledge base instantly.
* **Effortless Updates:** Any changes made to the knowledge base are immediately reflected in agent responses, with no extra configuration required.
* **Scalable and Maintainable:** Easily manage multiple agents and knowledge bases without complex logic or ongoing development.

### **Step 3:** Go to the Agent Goals Tab

  
* Inside the agent editor, click the **Agent Goals** tab to customize the agent's personality and logic.
* Under **Select knowledge base**, choose from your existing knowledge bases or click **Create New** to add a new one.
* **Tip:** Assign a KB that aligns with the agent’s function or audience (e.g., sales, product support).

### 

### **Step 4: Set When to Use the Knowledge Base (Trigger Prompt)**

  
* In the field labeled **When to use this knowledge base**, define a detailed prompt that guides the agent on when to activate the knowledge base.
* **Example:**  
“Use this knowledge base if the user asks any questions about the business, services, products, contact details, or other relevant information that requires accessing the business wiki to provide accurate and up-to-date information.”

### 

### **Step 5:** Write a Clear and Detailed Prompt

  
* A well-written prompt helps the agent match queries more accurately.
* The more precise the instruction, the better the agent's real-time response.
* Click **Save** to apply your settings and link the knowledge base to your agent.

## **Best Practices for Managing Voice AI Knowledge Bases**

  
Effective knowledge base usage goes beyond just setup—it requires thoughtful planning, prompt design, content maintenance, and performance monitoring.

  
* **Managing Multiple Knowledge Bases**  
    
Assigning different knowledge bases to various agents allows you to tailor responses for specific departments, products, or services.  
    
   * Create specialized knowledge bases for sales, support, or product information.  
   * Attach the relevant knowledge base to each agent for targeted expertise.
* **Optimizing Trigger Prompts**  
    
Well-crafted trigger prompts ensure the agent queries the knowledge base at the right moment.  
    
   * Use clear, specific language that matches common user intents.  
   * Test different prompts to find what works best for your audience.
* **Updating Knowledge Base Content**  
    
Keep your knowledge base content current to maintain accuracy in agent responses.  
    
   * Regularly review and update articles or FAQs.  
   * Changes are reflected instantly in all agent interactions.
* **Monitoring Agent Performance**  
    
Track how often the knowledge base is triggered and the quality of responses.  
    
   * Use analytics to identify gaps in your knowledge base.  
   * Refine prompts or content based on user feedback and agent logs.
