## **Action Description**

The **"Update Conversation AI Bot and Status"** action allows users to:

This provides precise control over how and when the Conversation AI bot interacts with contacts at an individual level.

  
## **Action Use Cases**

1. Assigning bots to individual communication channels.
2. Assigning bots to customized trigger conditions, such as:  
   * **Appointments booked**  
   * **Payments received**  
   * **Forms submitted**
3. Assigning bots based on custom tags.
4. Assigning bots using specific filter criteria or conditional logic (e.g., If-Else conditions).

## **Key Notes**

  
**Channel Compatibility:**
Ensure the bot assigned has the corresponding channel enabled. For example, if you assign a bot to handle Facebook interactions, verify that the **Facebook channel** is enabled for that bot.

**Branching Logic:**
This action assigns a bot to a contact and immediately branches out based on the workflow logic. It does **not** wait for the entire conversation to complete before branching out
