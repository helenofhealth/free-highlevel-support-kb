# What are Guided Content Questions in Social Planner?

Guided content questions are an advanced enhancement to Content AI inside Social Planner that help you create more relevant, targeted content. Instead of relying on generic AI prompts, you’ll now fill out a dynamic, platform-specific form that adapts based on your selected social platform and content type. This ensures your posts are optimized for each channel and perfectly aligned with your brand messaging.
