## **What is the Content AI Guided Content Questions Feature?**

  
The Content AI Guided Content Questions feature in Social Planner introduces an adaptive content generation experience. When creating a new post with Content AI, the form now dynamically adjusts its questions based on your selected social platform (like Facebook, Instagram, or LinkedIn) and content type (such as Post or Reel). This ensures you only answer the most relevant questions, making it easier to produce targeted, on-brand content for each channel.
