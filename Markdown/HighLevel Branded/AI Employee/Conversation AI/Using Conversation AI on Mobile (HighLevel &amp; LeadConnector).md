## What is Conversation AI on Mobile?

Conversation AI on mobile brings the power of AI-driven customer interaction to your fingertips. With two intelligent modes — Autopilot and Suggestive — this feature helps you respond faster, stay consistent, and maintain customer engagement even when you're not at your desk.

Mobile integration ensures you can engage with leads efficiently, no matter where you are, and with full control over AI behavior right from within your conversations.

## Key Benefits of Mobile Conversation AI

Mobile Conversation AI enhances responsiveness and control while reducing manual effort.

* Respond automatically when you’re unavailable using Autopilot Mode
* View and customize smart replies instantly in Suggestive Mode
* Quickly pause, resume, or schedule AI usage from your phone
* Maintain consistency across WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, and Instagram DMs
* Manage usage-based billing by monitoring AI activation on mobile
* Improve customer experience without compromising response quality

## How to Enable & Use Conversation AI on Mobile

To use AI on mobile, begin with a one-time setup on your desktop. Once configured, you can manage and utilize the feature directly through your mobile app conversations.

### Step 1: Set Up on Desktop (One-Time)

* Log in to your HighLevel desktop dashboard
* Go to Settings > Conversation AI
* Choose your preferred mode: Autopilot or Suggestive
* Set delay preferences if using Autopilot
* Train the AI using FAQs and/or the Web Crawler
* Save your settings

### Step 2: Use AI Within Mobile Conversations

* Open the HighLevel or LeadConnector mobile app
* Navigate to a conversation on WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, or Instagram
* Begin interacting to see AI support in action

### Step 3: Observe AI in Action

* In Autopilot Mode, AI replies are sent automatically after your configured delay
* In Suggestive Mode, suggested replies appear when you begin typing in the message box

## Autopilot Mode

Autopilot Mode enables Conversation AI to respond on your behalf, automatically, after a preset delay. This is ideal for managing conversations during off-hours, breaks, or high-volume periods.

How it Works:

* AI sends a reply without user input
* Delay settings are defined during desktop setup
* All responses are logged in the conversation history

Use this mode when you want to remain responsive even while away from your mobile or desktop.

## Suggestive Mode

Suggestive Mode provides real-time reply suggestions that appear the moment you open a conversation and tap the reply box.

How it Works:

* AI generates relevant suggestions based on the last message
* You can choose, edit, and send the response
* Full control remains with the user — nothing is sent automatically

This mode is ideal for users who want AI support without handing over full control.

## Managing Bot Settings on Mobile

You can toggle Conversation AI on or off directly from any conversation screen in the mobile app. This allows for responsive management of AI behavior, even while you're away from your computer.

Steps to Access AI Settings:

1. Open a conversation
2. Tap the ellipsis menu (three dots) in the top-right corner
3. Select Edit AI Settings
4. From the settings screen, you can:  
    
   * Turn AI on or off  
   * View AI status (Active, Paused, Reactivating)  
   * Schedule reactivation (e.g., “Turn back on in 2 hours”)

This gives you better control over customer interactions and helps you manage AI usage effectively, especially if you're working within a usage-based billing model.
