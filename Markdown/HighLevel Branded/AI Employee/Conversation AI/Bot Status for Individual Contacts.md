## **Introduction**

The **Bot Status for Individual Contacts** feature gives users enhanced control over when the AI bot interacts with specific contacts. From the message composer, users can easily monitor and set the bot active or inactive for each contact. This feature allows users to turn the bot on or off for individual contacts based on specific needs, ensuring a more personalized and flexible interaction.

  
## **Key Features:**

1. **Improved Bot Control:** You can now manually adjust the bot's status for each contact
2. **Active:** The bot will respond to all incoming messages.
3. **Sleep/Snooze:** The bot is temporarily paused, either manually or due to certain actions (e.g., when a manual or workflow message is sent, or message limits are reached).
4. **Inactive:** The bot remains off until manually reactivated.
5. **Sleep Timer:** Users can set a specific time for the bot to automatically wake up and start responding again.

  
## **Step 1: Access the Bot Status Feature**

* Go to the **Conversations** tab.
* In the **Message Composer** section for any contact, you will see the bot’s current status, indicated by a green online icon (if active).
