# **What is the Guided Form Bot?**

  
The Guided Form Bot is a user-friendly setup option within Conversation AI that removes the need for manual prompt engineering. Instead, it walks you through creating a bot using a structured form. You define key goals—like collecting contact details or answering FAQs—and the system builds a logic-driven, objective-based conversation flow behind the scenes.

###   

### **Step 2: Input Brand Information (Optional)**

  
While optional, adding brand information helps customize the tone and personality of your bot.

* Business Name
* Business Type
* Tone of Voice (e.g., professional, friendly, casual)

This allows the AI to respond more naturally in a tone consistent with your brand identity.

  
### **Step 3: Configure Basic Bot Settings**

  
These core settings determine how your bot behaves in conversations:

* **Initial Message**: The first thing the bot will say to users.
* **Language**: Select the language your bot should use.
* **Bot Name**: Give your bot a friendly identifier.
* **Behavior Type**:  
   * **Auto-Pilot**: Fully automated.  
   * **Suggestive**: Sends reply suggestions to the user.

  
### **Step 4: Define Objectives and Questions**

  
Add all the objectives you’d like the bot to complete.

* Use the **Add Question / Objective** button to create each.
* Enable **Skip if Already Filled** to prevent asking for existing contact data.
* Drag and drop questions to reorder them.

  
Common use cases:

* Ask for name, email, phone
* Qualify lead with Yes/No questions
* Offer scheduling links

### **Step 5: Setup Actions for Each Objective**

  
Once you’ve defined your questions, determine what the bot should do when objectives are completed.

  
Options include:

* **Trigger a Workflow** (e.g., enroll in email sequence)
* **Update a Custom Field** (e.g., save “Preferred Contact Time”)
* **Assign Tags** (e.g., “Interested in Demo”)

  
These actions help automate and personalize follow-ups based on user responses.

Before saving your bot, review all sections to make sure everything looks good. Then, configure any advanced settings:

* **Bot Availability**: Set time/day availability.
* **Channels**: Choose where the bot is active (SMS, Webchat, Instagram, etc.).
* **Fallback Message**: Custom message if the bot can’t handle a question.

  
Click **Save** to launch the bot!
