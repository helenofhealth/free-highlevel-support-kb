### **What is the Conversation AI Bot Snapshot Feature?**

  
The Conversation AI Bot Snapshot feature allows users to clone entire bots—including prompts, actions, and configurations—into a reusable snapshot. This eliminates the need to manually recreate bots across sub-accounts and ensures consistency in customer interactions, training data, and bot logic.

  
### **Key Benefits of Conversation AI Bot Snapshots**

  
Creating snapshots of your bots can streamline setup across accounts and reduce human error.

* Capture full bot configurations, including settings, prompts, and actions.
* Eliminate repetitive bot setup in every sub-account.
* Maintain consistency in tone and capabilities across all client accounts.
* Automatically set the imported bot as the primary bot (if one doesn’t already exist).
* Include all bot training data (Web Crawler URLs and FAQs).
* Choose how to handle existing bots in the destination—overwrite or skip them.

### **How to Create a Snapshot with Bots**

  
To replicate bots across sub-accounts, follow these steps to create a snapshot that includes your Conversation AI configurations.

1. Navigate to the **Account Snapshots** tab in your left-hand navigation menu.
2. Click **Create New Snapshot**.
3. Select the **source sub-account** that contains the bot you want to snapshot.
4. Enter a descriptive **name** for the snapshot.
5. Scroll to the **Conversation AI** section.
6. Review the bots listed. This section will include:  
   * Bot names  
   * Bot Training Web Crawler URLs  
   * Custom Bot Responses (FAQs)
7. Once reviewed, click **Create Snapshot**.

  
### **Conversation AI Snapshot Options & Behaviors**

  
Knowing what gets copied and how import rules work ensures a smoother bot migration process.

  
**Primary Bot Auto-Assignment**

If the destination sub-account doesn’t already have a primary bot, the imported bot from the snapshot will automatically be set as the primary.

  
**Conflict Handling**

If a bot with the same name already exists in the destination sub-account, you’ll have two options:

* **Overwrite** – Replace the existing bot with the one from the snapshot.
* **Skip** – Keep the existing bot and ignore the one from the snapshot.

  
**What’s Included in the Snapshot?**

* Complete bot structure: all actions and prompt-response mappings.
* Bot settings and configurations.
* Bot Training Web Crawler URLs.
* Custom FAQ data created via the Bot Training tab.

### **Frequently Asked Questions**

  
**Q: What if a bot with the same name already exists in the destination sub-account?**

During import, you’ll be prompted to overwrite the existing bot or skip the new one.

  
**Q: Will my prompt and action logic be preserved?**

Yes, the snapshot preserves all flows, actions, and responses exactly as configured.

  
**Q: Can I change the primary bot after importing a snapshot?**

Yes, if the snapshot bot doesn’t become the primary, you can manually assign it as primary from the Conversation AI settings.

  
**Q: Does this include training data like FAQs and Web Crawler links?**

Yes. All training data—including URLs and FAQs—are included in the snapshot.

  
**Q: Can I edit a snapshot later?**

No, snapshots are immutable. You must create a new snapshot if you make changes to the original bot.

### **Next Steps**

* After importing the snapshot, verify that the bot is functioning properly in the new sub-account.
* Manually assign it as the primary bot if it’s not automatically selected.
* Test the bot’s training data to ensure accurate responses.
* Continue building or modifying the bot for specific account needs using the **Bot Training** and **Bot Flow Builder** tools.
