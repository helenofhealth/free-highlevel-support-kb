We’re excited to roll out a new AI-powered assistant inside HighLevel, Ask AI. Whether you need content written in your brand voice, want to create a new community, or just need quick answers, Ask AI is here to help. No need to jump between tools or tabs.  
  
Ask AI would act as your built-in assistant inside GoHighLevel. We’re starting with a few key capabilities and will be continuously adding more over time.

## **What is Ask AI?**

Ask AI is a built-in virtual assistant for GoHighLevel users. It combines smart AI capabilities with your brand context to help you take action inside HighLevel, directly from a single interface. You’ll find the Ask AI icon in the top navigation bar.

Note: In order to generate personalized/branded content, make sure that you have configured your brand voice in Marketing > Branded Content > Brand Voice..

  
## **Who can use Ask AI?**

Currently Ask AI is only available to the Agency Admins and the Sub-accounts on the 97$ Unlimited AI Employee Plan. It can be found and used in the top navigation bar, click on the icon and enter your prompts.  
  
## **What can the bot do?**

Here’s a closer look at what Ask AI currently supports:

1. Create Branded Content: No more generic AI writing, the bot pulls in your brand voice settings to generate content that sounds like you. From email newsletters to social captions, it creates high-quality content tailored to your tone and brand voice settings.
2. Create Communities: Setting up a new community no longer requires digging through menus. Just tell the bot what kind of community you want to create, and it will guide you step-by-step, all from the chat.
3. Answer Questions or Help with Ideas: Need inspiration for a campaign? Want ideas about a blog CTA? Directly send them to Ask AI.
