# **What is Auto Follow-Up in Conversation AI?**

  
Auto Follow-Up is an intelligent automation tool within HighLevel’s Conversation AI that detects when a contact drops off, becomes inactive, or requests a future follow-up, and then schedules and sends follow-up messages automatically. By leveraging AI, the system recognizes common drop-off scenarios—such as a user saying they’re busy, asking for a specific follow-up time, or simply not replying—and ensures that your leads remain engaged without requiring manual intervention.

---

## **Key Benefits of Auto Follow-Up**

  
Auto Follow-Up delivers several user-focused advantages designed to streamline communication and maximize results.

* Reduces manual workload by automating follow-up messages, freeing up your team’s time.
* Boosts engagement with timely, personalized outreach that keeps conversations alive.
* Minimizes lead leakage by ensuring no contact is forgotten or left unengaged.
* Supports custom messaging so you can use AI-generated follow-ups or craft your own.
* Integrates with workflows to tag contacts, assign conversations, or notify users as needed.
* Respects business hours by only sending follow-ups during your defined working hours.
* Switches channels dynamically to maximize deliverability (e.g., from Live Chat to SMS).
* Provides full visibility with all scheduled follow-ups displayed in the Response Info panel.

## **How To Setup Auto Follow-Up in Conversation AI**

  
Proper setup of Auto Follow-Up ensures your Conversation AI bot can re-engage leads effectively and in alignment with your business needs. Follow these steps to enable and configure Auto Follow-Up:

  
**Note:** Do not trigger another followup through a workflow—this breaks the follow-up logic.

  
### **Step 1:** Navigate to the Conversation AI Bot

  
1. ###  
Log in to your HighLevel account.
2. From the left-hand menu, click on **AI Agents**.
3. Select **Conversation AI**.

4. Choose one of the following:  
    
   1. **Create a new bot.** (Follow this guide to setup a new bot: **[Setting Up Conversation AI](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/155000004401-setting-up-conversation-ai)**)  
         
   **![](https://jumpshare.com/v/ACGvVs9XoxMHopcl431D+/Screen+Shot+2025-06-11+at+7.25.00+PM.png)**

### **Step 3:** Enable Follow-Up Scenarios

  
Each follow-up scenario defines when the bot should send follow-ups. HighLevel currently supports 3 main scenarios:

####   

#### **Scenario 1: Contact Stopped Responding**

  
1. Toggle ON the **Enable scenario** button.
2. You can now add up to **5 follow-up sequences** for this condition.
3. For each sequence:  
    
   * **Set the delay time** in hours, days, or minutes.  
   * Choose **Let AI Send the Message** _(Auto-generate contextual messages based on the conversation)_.  
   * Or, **turn OFF** and enter a **Custom message** manually.  
   * **Trigger a Workflow (Optional)** : Toggle ON if you want to trigger an existing workflow and select it from the list.
4. Click on the **\+ Add Followup** button to add a new sequence.

####   
  
#### **Scenario 2: Contact Marked as Busy**

  
1. Toggle ON the **Enable scenario** button.
2. You can now add up to **5 follow-up sequences** for this condition.
3. Repeat the same configuration steps as above:  
    
   * Set **delay** **time**  
   * Choose **AI-generated** or **C** **ustom** message  
   * Assign a **T** **rigger** W**orkflow** (optional)

####   

#### **Scenario 3: Contact Requested a Follow-Up**

  
1. Toggle ON the **Enable** **scenario** button.
2. You can now add up to **5 follow-up sequences** for this condition.
3. Repeat the same process:  
    
   * Set **delay time** (The **first sequence for this scenario will be pre-set** as per the contact's request)  
   * Choose **AI-generated** or **C** **ustom** message  
   * Assign a **T** **rigger** W**orkflow** (optional)

### **Step 4:** Follow-Up Settings

  
To improve engagement and respect timing preferences, configure these advanced options:

####   

#### **A. Set Follow-Up Working Hours**  
  
1. Click on **Follow-Up Settings.**
2. Enable **Working Hours** toggle.
3. Set the specific hours when follow-up messages should be sent (e.g., 9 AM – 6 PM).
4. If disabled, messages will send **regardless of time**.
5. Click on **Save**.

  
**Note:** This setting **ONLY** applies to follow-up messages, not to the main AI agent conversations.

#### **B. Enable Dynamic Channel Switching**

  
1. Click on **Follow-Up Settings.**
2. Enable **Dynamic Channel Switching.**
3. This allows the AI to automatically switch to another available channel if the original one becomes inactive.  
    
   * For example, if the contact doesn’t respond on Live Chat, the bot may follow up via **SMS**, **Facebook Messenger**, **Instagram**, or **WhatsApp**, depending on available channels.
4. Click on **Save**.

### **Step 5:** Save Your Follow-Up Settings

  
1. Finally, click the global **Save** button to confirm and activate the Follow-Up Actions for the bot.

## **Smart Detection of Drop-Off Scenarios**

  
Auto Follow-Up uses AI to recognize when a contact has disengaged, is busy, or requests a later follow-up, ensuring no opportunity slips through the cracks.

* Detects when a contact stops replying after a set interval.
* Identifies “busy” responses (e.g., “I’m driving”).
* Recognizes requests for follow-up at a specific time and schedules accordingly.

---

## **Dynamic Channel Switching**

  
To maximize engagement, Auto Follow-Up can switch channels if a contact is unresponsive, helping you reach contacts where they’re most likely to reply.

* Switches from Live Chat to SMS if chat is inactive and a phone number is available.
* On platforms like Facebook, Instagram, or WhatsApp, switches to SMS if no response within 24 hours.
* This feature is optional and can be disabled.

---

## **Full Visibility in AI Response Info**

  
All scheduled follow-ups are displayed in the Response Info panel, giving you complete transparency and control over your automated outreach.

  
* Easily track which follow-ups are pending and why.
* Maintain oversight of all automated communication.
