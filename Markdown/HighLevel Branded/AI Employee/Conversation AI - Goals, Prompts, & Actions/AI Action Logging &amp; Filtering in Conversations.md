# **What is AI Action Logging in Conversations?**

  
AI Action Logging provides visibility into automated actions triggered by AI bots during conversations with leads and customers. This feature adds traceable log entries for each bot-initiated action, helping users better understand and manage AI automation.

## **Key Benefits of AI Action Logging & Filtering**

  
Gain deeper insight into how bots are operating within your conversations, helping you maintain better control and clarity over automations.

 • Provides transparency on AI-triggered actions like field updates or workflow triggers.

 • Simplifies troubleshooting and auditing of bot activity.

 • Enables users to filter and review only AI-driven events.

 • Clearly tags bot-booked appointments with their source.

 • Improves operational visibility and accountability within Conversations AI.

 • Builds confidence in the automation process by showing behind-the-scenes actions.

## **How To Use AI Action Logs & Filters**

  
Learn how to view and filter the new AI log entries directly in your Conversations panel to better track bot behavior.

 1\. **Open the Conversations Panel** in your HighLevel account.

 2\. Review conversation threads. AI actions such as:

 • _“Workflow triggered by Bot”_

 • _“Contact field updated by AI Employee”_

 • _“Bot Stopped”_

will now appear as log entries.

 3\. To **filter by AI Action Logs**:

 • Click the **Filter icon** in the top-right corner of the Conversations panel.

 • Choose **“AI Action Logs”** from the dropdown.

 • The panel will display only the messages involving bot-triggered actions.

## **AI Action Logs**

  
AI Action Logs capture and display when a bot performs an automation task during a conversation. These logs make it easy to verify when and how the bot is interacting with the contact.

  
Types of actions logged include:

 • Workflow triggered

 • Contact field updated

 • Stop bot command

  
These logs appear chronologically in the conversation thread, marked by an “AI Employee” label for clarity.

  
---

## **AI Action Log Filter**

  
The AI Action Log Filter allows you to narrow down the conversation to show only automated bot activities. This provides a cleaner view when troubleshooting or auditing AI behavior.

  
Use this feature to:

 • Verify if a bot triggered the intended automation.

 • Isolate only AI actions without scrolling through unrelated messages.

 • Understand exactly what steps were taken automatically during a conversation.

---

## **Appointment Source Tagging**

  
Now when a bot books an appointment during a conversation, the appointment will automatically be tagged with the source **“Conversations AI.”** This creates more visibility into where your appointments are coming from and helps with tracking automation performance.

  
Benefits include:

 • Knowing which bookings are driven by bots vs. human users.

 • Improved attribution and performance tracking of bot campaigns.

 • Easier segmentation or follow-up reporting based on source.

**Q: What kind of bot actions are currently logged?**
