# **What is this feature?**

  
The Conversation AI is an advanced feature that leverages AI technologies to enhance customer interactions and automate the appointment booking process. It consists of two primary modes:

  
## **Suggestive Mode:**

In this mode, AI generates real-time predictive text suggestions to assist users in responding to customer messages. The suggestions appear as options, allowing users to either send the AI-suggested message as is, customize it before sending it, or dismiss the suggestion.

  
## **Auto-Pilot Mode:**

This mode fully automates responses to inbound messages using AI to guide customers toward booking appointments. If an inbound message is received, the system waits 2 minutes before calling the GPT API to account for multiple potential messages.

  
**Please note:**

The availability of the Auto-Pilot mode will be limited to a private beta for now and a select group of users has been shortlisted for testing and feedback purposes., while the Suggestive mode will be accessible for all users.

  
The system design follows certain conditions for start, sleep, and end states, including manual user intervention, out-of-context responses, and appointment link delivery. It uses the last 10 conversations or up to an 800-word limit for prompt engineering, ensuring context-sensitive responses.

  
This feature can be integrated into a variety of live channels, including SMS, Google My Business (GMB), Facebook (FB), and Instagram (IG). It employs advanced usage and pricing models based on message generation while also providing the capability for performance tracking with detailed metrics.

##   
**Usage Cases:**

### **Suggestive Mode:**

  
**Healthcare Clinic:**

A local healthcare clinic can utilize Conversation AI in suggestive mode to streamline appointment bookings. When patients inquire about service details or available appointment slots, the AI responds promptly with relevant information and suggests appropriate responses. This improves response time and enhances the patient experience.

  
**Fitness Center:**

Conversation AI in suggestive mode efficiently handles inquiries and bookings for a fitness center offering various classes and membership plans. Potential clients asking about class schedules or membership details receive instant responses from the AI and suggestions for further actions. The suggestive mode allows staff to quickly respond to queries and provide personalized assistance.

  
**Restaurant:**

Restaurants benefit from Conversation AI in suggestive mode to manage table reservation requests. When customers inquire about table availability, the AI responds with available time slots and provides suggestions for booking. Additionally, the suggestive mode assists staff in promptly responding to unique requests, such as dietary restrictions or special arrangements.

  
### **Auto-Pilot Mode (Private Beta):**

  
**Healthcare Clinic:**

With Conversation AI in auto-pilot mode, a local healthcare clinic can automate responses to inbound messages, guiding patients toward booking appointments. The AI provides available timings, guides patients in selecting a slot, and sends them a booking link. This mode reduces manual intervention and ensures a seamless appointment booking process.

  
**Fitness Center:**

In auto-pilot mode (private beta), Conversation AI automates responses for a fitness center. When potential clients message about class schedules or membership plans, the AI guides them toward booking a trial class or membership. This mode lets staff focus on other tasks while maintaining an efficient customer booking process.

  
**Restaurant:**

In auto-pilot mode (private beta), Conversation AI handles restaurant table reservation requests. When customers inquire about table availability, the AI provides time slots and directs them to a booking link. The auto-pilot mode ensures a prompt and streamlined reservation process.

  
**Real Estate Agency:**

Conversation AI in auto-pilot mode (private beta) assists real estate agencies in managing property viewing appointments.

# **How to Rebill Conversation AI?**

Adjust Rebill Amount: This step is crucial if you plan to rebill your customers for using the AI service.  
Head to the **SAAS Configurator** in your Agency Sidebar. Scroll down on the right to Conversation AI.  
  
Enter the amount you plan to charge your customers per message. For instance, if your cost is $0.05 per message and you want to profit, you could charge customers $0.07.

### ![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155001429891/original/qOMTBMN73VGuZxL9YhtvDerVKlOeo_K1rg.png?1687286049)

  
In this rebilling example, you, as an agency, bear the $0.05/message cost. You then charge your customer $0.07/message, 1.4 times your cost. This results in a profit of $0.02/message. With $10, you can generate approximately 145 messages.

  
You can change the rebilling multiplier for individual SAAS accounts by heading to **Sub-Accounts> Scrolling to that sub-account> Manage Client** (or clicking on their name.)![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155001430551/original/uXBzpgTKIVl-MudMuXjzapGgS6GIBhuQJg.png?1687287227)
