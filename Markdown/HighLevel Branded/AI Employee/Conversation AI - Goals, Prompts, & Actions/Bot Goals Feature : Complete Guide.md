## Introduction

The **Bot Goals** feature is a comprehensive update to the existing **Configure Intent** feature within the conversation AI newer version. In this feature you will be able to edit or update prompts for new or existing bots. 

Additional sub-features like **Trigger a Workflow** and **Update Contact Info** will be included soon, offering more customisation and functionality.

Additionally, the former **Bot Trial** feature has been integrated under the name **Test Your Bot**, providing a unified experience within the Bot Goals feature.

  
## Key Changes in the New Version

* **Support for Multiple Bots:** Unlike the previous version, which only supported a single bot, the updated version allows you to create **multiple bots**. This enables you to tailor bots for specific purposes, such as General Q&A, Appointment Booking, and more.  
   * Example: You can create one bot for handling general queries and another bot dedicated solely to appointment scheduling.

### Step 2: Navigating the Bot Interface

* **Bot Settings:** This remains the same as the previous version, with no functional changes.
* **Bot Training:** Similar to Bot Settings, there are no changes to this section.
* **Bot Goals:** This is the new feature introduced in the latest version, which includes sub-features like - Trigger a workflow, Update contact info (coming soon) for customising your bot's behaviour.

### Step 3: Customising Your Bot Goals

* In the **Bot Goals** tab, you can access the **Prompt** section, where you can add or update the AI prompts as per your goals.
* For each goal you want the bot to achieve, you'll need to create a new bot and a corresponding prompt.  
   * If you're setting up a prompt for a new goal, you’ll need to create a new bot and customise the prompt in that bot’s **Bot Goals** section.

#### Sub-Features within Bot Goals

There are three primary sub-features under **Bot Goals**:

1. **Appointment Booking:** A new sub-feature, **Transfer Employee Post Appointment Booking**, has been added within the **Appointment Booking** section. This enhancement allows users to seamlessly transfer the conversation to a different bot once the intended action—such as successfully booking an appointment—has been completed.  
Users can select the next bot from a dropdown list, ensuring that the conversation continues smoothly with the appropriate bot,
2. **Trigger a Workflow:** Coming Soon
3. **Add Contact Info:** Coming Soon

You can access detailed help documents for each of these sub-features by clicking the respective links within the platform.
