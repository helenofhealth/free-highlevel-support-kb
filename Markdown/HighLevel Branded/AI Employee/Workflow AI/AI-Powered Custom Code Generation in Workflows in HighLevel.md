# **What is AI-Powered Code Generation in Workflows?**

Writing custom code in workflows just became smarter, faster, and easier with **Code with AI (Beta)**. This new feature enables users to generate JavaScript code snippets by simply describing their desired functionality in plain language, reducing the need for manual coding and debugging.

  
## **Key Benefits of AI-Powered Code Generation**

Leveraging AI for code generation enhances productivity and minimizes the technical barrier for users. Key advantages include:

* **AI-Powered Code Generation** – Simply describe what you need, and AI generates the corresponding JavaScript code.
* **Automated Property Integration** – AI automatically maps input properties from previous workflow steps.
* **One-Click Implementation** – Quickly review and insert AI-generated code into your workflow.
* **Easy Regeneration** – Need a different version? Click Generate again for an updated snippet.
* **Enhanced Efficiency** – Reduce the time and technical expertise required for custom coding.

## **How to Use Code with AI**

Follow these steps to generate and implement custom code seamlessly within your workflows:

1. **Select Custom Code Action** – Choose the Custom Code action within your workflow.

5. **Review and Implement** – Examine the output and click **Use Code** to insert it into your workflow.

> **Pro Tip:** The more specific your prompt, the better the AI-generated code will be!

## **Example Use Cases**

Here are some practical ways to leverage AI-powered code generation in your workflows:

* **Data Formatting** – Convert phone numbers or dates into a standardized format.
* **API Integration** – Generate code to fetch data from external services via HTTP requests.
* **Mathematical Calculations** – Perform real-time calculations such as interest rates or discounts.
* **String Manipulation** – Extract key details from text, such as pulling email addresses from subject lines.
* **Conditional Logic** – Implement custom decision-making processes, such as routing leads based on specific criteria.
