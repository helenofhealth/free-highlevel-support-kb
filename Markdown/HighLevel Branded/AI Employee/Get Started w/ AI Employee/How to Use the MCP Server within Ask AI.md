Ask AI has graduated from answering questions to executing actions. Whether you need to create a contact, reschedule an appointment, or bulk-update opportunities, you can now instruct the chat—and HighLevel’s Master Control Panel (MCP) does the work instantly. No menu diving, no tab switching, just conversational commands that save serious time.

## Key Benefits of MCP-Powered Ask AI 

Educational overview: Turning chat into an action engine transforms how teams operate, collapsing long click-paths into a single sentence.

* Zero-Click Workflows: Type “Add Jane Smith to the ‘NY Leads’ pipeline”—it’s done.
* Context ↔ Action Loop: Ask for data, then act on it in the same thread (“Tag them as Hot”).
* Universal Coverage: Anything the MCP API supports—contacts, payments, automations—now runs in chat.
* Role-Aware Safety: Permissions match your user role; no one can exceed their access level.
* Audit & Undo: Every action logs to Activity Feed; destructive commands ask for confirmation.

## How It Works 

1. Parse Intent: The AI identifies the verb (create, update, delete) and the object (contact, invoice).
2. Generate Payload: It maps your words to MCP fields (e.g., firstName, pipelineId).
3. Permission Check: The system verifies you have rights to run that action.
4. Confirmation (Destructive Only): For delete or bulk edits, Ask AI shows a summary and asks “Proceed?”
5. Execute & Respond: MCP runs the call; success or error details return inline and log to Audit Feed.

## Command Syntax & Examples 

  
| Action Type | Natural-Language Example                                             | Behind-the-Scenes MCP Call             |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Create      | “Create a contact named John Doe with phone 555-1234 in Location A.” | createContact()                        |
| Update      | “Change pipeline stage of Opportunity #456 to ‘Won’.”                | updateOpportunity()                    |
| Query       | “Show me tomorrow’s booked appointments.”                            | listAppointments()                     |
| Delete      | “Delete coupon code SUMMER25.”                                       | deleteCoupon() (confirmation required) |
| Bulk        | “Tag all contacts from last week’s webinar as ‘Webinar-2025’.”       | Iterates updateContact()               |

Tip: End with “and show me the result” to receive a JSON snippet for quick validation.

## Safety & Permissions 

* Role Enforcement: Your chat privileges mirror UI permissions—no secret back doors.
* Confirmation Prompts: Any irreversible change triggers a human “Yes / No” step.
* Audit Logs: Find every AI-initiated action under Settings ▸ Audit Logs ▸ AI Chat.
* Credit Usage: Each successful MCP command costs 1 AI credit; previews/denied commands are free.

## Best-Practice Prompt Recipes 

1. Single-Action Command  
   * “Create invoice for $299 for contact john@demo.com due in 30 days.”
2. Two-Step Data → Action  
   * “List opportunities lost this week, then move them to ‘Re-Engage’ stage.”
3. Conditional Logic  
   * “For contacts tagged ‘Trial-Ending’, if last login > 14 days ago, move to ‘Churn Risk’ pipeline.”

## Frequently Asked Questions

Q: How do I see what the AI actually sent to the server?  
 A: Click the timestamp of the chat reply to open the raw JSON payload in the Audit Log sidebar.

Q: Can I reverse a mistaken action?  
 A: Use “Undo last action” within 5 minutes or restore from backups (Contacts CSV, etc.).

Q: Are bulk actions throttled?  
 A: Yes—1,000 records per minute to protect system performance.

Q: Does this work on mobile?  
 A: Read-only today; MCP actions launch on iOS & Android in Q4 2025.

Q: Can I restrict certain verbs (e.g., delete)?  
 A: Admins can toggle Allow AI Deletes per role under Settings ▸ Security ▸ AI Controls.

Q: What happens if the AI misunderstands my prompt?  
 A: It responds with a clarification question; no action runs until you confirm.
  
  
### Next Steps

1. Open Ask AI in any Location and type “Create a test contact named Demo Bot”.
2. Check Audit Logs to view the JSON payload.
3. Try a safe bulk command (“Tag the last 5 contacts as Test”) and watch rate-limit handling.
4. Review AI Controls to ensure destructive commands match your security policy.
