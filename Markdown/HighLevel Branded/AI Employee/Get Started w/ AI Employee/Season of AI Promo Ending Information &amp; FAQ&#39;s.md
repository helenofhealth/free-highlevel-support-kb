The Season of AI promotion has officially concluded, and it’s time to transition into the post-promotion phase. This article will walk you through the key changes, billing details, and steps to ensure a smooth transition for your agency and sub-accounts.
  
  
**IMPORTANT:** Agencies will **ONLY** be charged by HighLevel for sub-accounts that have **opted** into the Season of AI promotion and selected the **Unlimited Plan**. This means that if you are rebilling your customers for AI features, you will turn a profit after HighLevel charges your agency.
