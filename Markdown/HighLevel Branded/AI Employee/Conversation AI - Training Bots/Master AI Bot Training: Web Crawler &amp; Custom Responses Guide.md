### **How to Add URLs to Web Crawler**

  
Providing the bot with URLs is a critical step in creating a robust knowledge base. By adding URLs, you allow the Web Crawler to extract and utilize specific information from websites, ensuring the bot has access to accurate and contextually relevant data for customer interactions.

  
**HighLevel Pro Tips:** Here are some HighLevel Pro Tips and Best Practices to help you get the most out of training your bot with the Web Crawler!  
  
* Ensure that the URLs and documents are up-to-date and relevant.
* Focus on commonly asked questions and high-priority topics.
* Structure the content clearly for easier parsing.
  
  
### **Step 1:** Choose Domain Type and Enter Domain

  
There are multiple domain types that you can crawl when training your bot. The domain type that you choose will dictate how many URLs will be crawled to train your bot.

  
* **Exact URLs**: Crawls a specific webpage to use its data for training. For example, entering `https://www.gohighlevel.com/` limits the crawl to that exact webpage.
* **All URLs with Path**: Crawls all pages within a specific path. For example, entering `https://www.gohighlevel.com/marketing` includes all pages using that URL path, such as `/marketing/offers` or `/marketing/promotions` `. `
* **All URLs in Domain**: Crawls all pages within a domain. For example, entering `https://www.gohighlevel.com/promo` includes all pages with the root domain `www.gohighlevel.com`.

### **Step 3:** Select Crawled URLs

  
All the crawled URLs will appear in a list, giving you the ability to select any number of the URLs to use as training data for your bot. You can **"select all" URLs**, or **select individual URLs** by clicking the checkbox next to the URL you want to add into your training data.
