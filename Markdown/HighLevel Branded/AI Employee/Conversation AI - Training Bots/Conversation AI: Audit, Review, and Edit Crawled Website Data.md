## **What's New?**

Weâ€™ve added a new feature that simplifies the review and editing of data scraped from websites during Bot Training. This update enables users to better understand the collected information and provides the ability to easily make necessary changes.

## **How It Works:**

Go to the Bot Training tab. In the Uploaded Links table, you'll find a document icon next to each website URL.

Click the document icon to open a modal displaying all the scraped content from the selected website.

You can directly edit this information within the text box to update or correct any data.

After saving your edits, the Bot will be retrained using the updated content.

Edited data will be tagged as "Edited" indicating changes have been made post-crawling.

### **Note:**

Refreshing the edited website will revert the content to the original data pulled from the site.
