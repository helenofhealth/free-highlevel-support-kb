If you're offering domain purchases as part of your SaaS plan, this article will show you how to enable that feature for your clients—and optionally rebill them through your connected Stripe account. You’ll learn how to activate domain reselling, set your own pricing margin, and determine who pays (you or your client) based on your toggle settings. This setup is ideal for agencies who want to generate recurring revenue and simplify the domain buying experience for their clients.

  
- **Agencies on** **Any Plan** ($97, $970, $297, $2970, $497, $4970) can access Domain Purchase.  
  
- Once Domain Purchase is enabled via the Agency settings, existing and new sub accounts will see an option to purchase domain  
  
- For agencies to avoid accruing execution costs for EXISTING Sub-Accounts, rebilling will need to be enabled **manually** for each Sub-Account within the Agency view.  
  
- If Domain Purchase is **enabled** on the SaaS Configurator, new Sub-Accounts generated will automatically be enrolled in Domain Purchase, **no further** action is required by the agency.

## **Re-billing the costs to your clients and making a profit**

**(only for 497 SaaS Agencies)**

  
Once you have enabled Domain Purchase in your agency account, it will be automatically enabled for all your clients to use. You can bill your clients at cost or add markup.

## **How to turn on re-billing for my clients?**

  
1. Ensure you have enabled **Domain Purchase** for your Agency first. (see instructions)
2. If the sub-account isn't in SaaS Mode already, switch the sub-account into SaaS Mode by going into your **Agency account** \> **Accounts tab** \> **Scroll to the sub-account** \> Click the **three dots icon** and select "**Switch to SaaS.**" [How to convert a location to SaaS](https://help.gohighlevel.com/en/support/solutions/articles/48001184920).
3. In **Agency account** \> **Accounts tab** \> Scroll to the **Sub-Account** \> Click the **View Details** link > Scroll to the **Domain Purchase** Re-Sell Settings section and toggle it on.
4. Use the slider to set the amount of markup you like to make and hit save!
5. Rinse and repeat for all your Sub-Accounts where you wish to rebill for usage.

## **How does re-billing work?**

  
* Agencies pay HighLevel and get invoices with high-level branding
* Sub-accounts (your clients) pay you (the agency) and get invoices with your branding. The money is deposited in your Stripe account connected to your agency level. [How do I connect my agency's Stripe account to collect client payments?](https://help.gohighlevel.com/en/support/solutions/articles/48001171910)

  
This is very similar to other products that use re-billing or reselling models in the platform. Just like LC Phone or LC Email re-billing, re-billing of the Domain Purchase also utilizes "credits" from the agency wallet & the location wallet, respectively.

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

  
**Q: Who gets charged for the domain, me or my client?**  
This depends on whether Rebilling is enabled. If rebilling is OFF, your agency pays for the domain and absorbs the cost. If rebilling is ON, your client is charged through your Stripe account, using the price you set.  
  
**Q: Do I need a Stripe account to enable rebilling?**  
Yes. You must have Stripe connected through the SaaS Configurator to use rebilling. Without Stripe, clients will not be charged and the domain cost will default to your agency.  
  
**Q: Can clients buy domains directly from their sub-account?**  
Yes. Once domain reselling is enabled, clients can go to **Settings > Domains** in their sub-account, search for a domain, and purchase it without needing to leave the platform.  
  
**Q: Is this feature available to all agency plans?**  
No. You must be on a plan that includes SaaS Mode and have Stripe connected to use domain rebilling.
