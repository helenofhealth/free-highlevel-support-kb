### **Why This Playbook Matters?**

You fix leaks, replace water heaters, and handle emergencies—but what are you doing to keep your pipeline of customers flowing?

  
Most plumbers rely on word-of-mouth or one-time calls, but in today’s digital world…

  
###  Industry Metrics:

* ✅ 76% of customers research plumbing services on social media before calling.
* ✅ 47% of homeowners book the first plumber they find online with recent content or reviews.
* ✅ Businesses that post 3+ times per week generate **2.5X more leads**.

  
Yet most plumbing businesses:

* Don’t post consistently.

* Don’t know what content actually drives bookings.

| **LinkedIn**  | Facility managers, B2B plumbing contracts             |
| **YouTube**   | Plumbing tips, product installs, “how to avoid clogs” |
| **GBP**       | Reviews, contact, and local SEO ranking               |

  
**Use Case:**
