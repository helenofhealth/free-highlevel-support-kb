### **Step 1: Get Found with Google Ads & Local Services Ads**

#### **Why It Matters?**

When a pipe bursts, no one waits. They **Google it. Then book fast.**  
You need to be at the top—**or someone else gets that call.**

  
**Fact**: LSA (Local Services Ads) cost less per job than traditional Google Ads when set up correctly.

  
#### **1.1 Set Up Google Local Services Ads (LSA)**

* Appear at the top for searches like:  
   * “Emergency plumber near me”  
   * “Drain cleaning services”  
   * “Toilet repair urgent”
* Only pay for verified leads
* Get the **Google Guaranteed** badge to increase trust & conversions (up to 30% higher)
  
  
**Example**:  
A plumbing company targeting “24/7 leak repair” saw a **35% conversion rate** and $25 CPL via LSA.
