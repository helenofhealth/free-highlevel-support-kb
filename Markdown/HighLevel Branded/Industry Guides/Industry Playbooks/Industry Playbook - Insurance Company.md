The roadmap for growing a local Insurance Company online is simple: capture new leads, conversationally convert those leads into sales, turn those customers into positive reviews, and then reactivate those customers into repeat buyers. Here’s the playbook:

  
**Capture More Leads**

  
* Install the [SMS Webchat Widget](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/48000984860-highlevel-chat-widget-how-to-add-it-to-your-pages-in-minutes) on the Insurance Company’s website.
* Integrate the Insurance Company’s [Google Business Profile](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/48001222899-how-to-integrate-your-gmb-into-the-crm) to activate Google Chat
* Activate The [Missed-Call Text-Back](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/48001239140-where-and-how-to-configure-the-missed-call-text-back-feature) so that any unanswered calls to the Insurance Company immediately receive a text message saying, “Sorry we missed your call - how can we help?”

  
**Nurture Leads into Bookings**

  
* Configure helpful [Text Snippets](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/155000000890-message-templates-snippets-) for phrases & links the Insurance Company often sends to people.
* [Activate Conversation AI](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/155000000210-how-to-use-conversation-ai-in-your-appointment-bookings-) so the Insurance Company has a fully trained, always-on assistant to conversationally convert leads into bookings.

  
**Turn Leads into Sales**

  
* Configure Payment Integration for [Payment Forms](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/155000000559-selling-products-on-order-forms-with-available-payment-providers-faqs), [Paid Appointment Calendars](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/155000000875-calendar-payments), [Text-2-Pay](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/48001202185-text-to-pay-links), and [Tap-2-Pay](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/155000000950-tap-to-pay).

  
**Turn Sales into Positive Reviews**

  
* Configure [Email & SMS Review Request](https://help.gohighlevel.com/a/solutions/articles/48001222668?portalId=48000045315) Templates so the Insurance Company can quickly & easily request reviews with the tap of a button.

  
**Turn Sales into Repeat Customers**

  
* Configure Newsletter [Email Template](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/48001215255-email-templates-vs-email-campaigns) so the Insurance Company can easily send out news, updates, and promotions to their contacts.
