## Why This Playbook Matters

You're great at helping clients buy, sell, or invest in property—but are you leveraging social media to keep your deal flow consistent year-round?

  
Many real estate consultants struggle with slow months, low visibility, and high competition because they rely too heavily on referrals and outdated platforms.

  
### Industry Reality:

✅ 85% of home buyers and sellers check an agent’s online presence before calling  
✅ 43% of sellers hire the first agent they see on social media  
✅ Agents who post consistently generate 3X more leads

  
Yet most consultants:

* Don’t post consistently
* Only promote listings (no brand story or value)
* Don’t automate lead capture or follow-ups

This playbook shows you how to build a powerful brand, attract high-quality leads, and convert followers into clients using HighLevel.

### Why It Matters

People work with real estate pros they know and trust. Social media is how they get to know you—before they ever pick up the phone.

---

### 1.1 Pick the Right Platforms for Real Estate Consultants

✅ Facebook → Local listings, community reputation, neighborhood targeting  
✅ Instagram → Storytelling, behind-the-scenes, video walkthroughs  
✅ LinkedIn → Investor outreach, B2B referrals, relocation partnerships  
✅ YouTube → SEO-friendly property tours, market updates, long-form credibility  
✅ Google Business Profile → Essential for ranking and reviews
