## Why This Playbook Matters

Many real estate consultants depend heavily on referrals, open houses, or third-party platforms like Zillow and Realtor.com. But that leaves them vulnerable to market shifts, slow months, and rising competition.

Today’s buyers and sellers search online before ever calling a real estate expert.

  
### Industry Reality:

✅ 97% of homebuyers start with Google  
✅ 68% of seller leads say ads influenced who they contacted  
✅ 71% of real estate leads are lost due to slow or no follow-up  
✅ Ads with automated follow-ups convert up to 4x better

  
If your competitors are running Google and Facebook ads—and you’re not—you're losing listings, buyer leads, and long-term clients without even knowing it.

  
This playbook is your blueprint for using HighLevel to run ads that drive qualified real estate leads and turn clicks into closings.

## Step 1: Get Found with Google Search & Local Service Ads (LSA)

### Why It Matters

When homeowners think about selling or buying, the first thing they do is search “real estate agent near me” or “home value in \[City\].” You need to appear on Page 1—and ideally at the top.

Google Ads (PPC) and Google Local Services Ads (LSA) are the fastest way to get there.

---

### 1.1 Set Up Google Local Services Ads (LSA)

✅ Appear at the top of results for high-intent searches like:

* “Top real estate consultant in \[City\]”
* “Sell my house fast”
* “Home value estimator”

✅ Only pay for valid leads (calls, messages—not just clicks)  
✅ Apply for the Google Guaranteed badge (improves trust & CTR by 30%)  
✅ Target sellers, investors, FSBOs, or relocations

**Example Use Case:**  
A Los Angeles-based consultant running LSAs for “Home Value Reports in West Hollywood” generated 17 listing appointments in 30 days at $18 per lead.

---

### 1.2 Run Buyer & Seller PPC Ads

✅ Target high-intent keywords like:

* “Real estate agent in \[ZIP\]”
* “Home valuation tool”
* “Condos for sale in \[Neighborhood\]”

✅ Link to funnels with offers like:

* “Get Your Home’s Value in 2 Minutes”
* “Tour This Week’s Off-Market Listings”

✅ Use call tracking in HighLevel to measure what’s working

**Budget Tip:** Start at $30/day and focus on hyper-local high-ROI services (e.g., new listings, distressed sales, probate properties)

---

### 1.3 Enable Call Tracking on Your GBP & Website

✅ Use HighLevel call tracking numbers across all ads  
✅ Recover missed opportunities with SMS text-back  
✅ Log every inbound call automatically into your CRM

**Example:**  
A missed-call follow-up automation recovered 22% of lost seller calls within one week for a Chicago-based agent.

---

## Step 2: Run Facebook & Instagram Ads for Local Lead Gen

### Why It Matters

Most buyers and sellers don’t start with intent they start by browsing. Facebook and Instagram are the best way to warm them up before they start searching.

#### [Connect Facebook with Ad Manager](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/155000003044-connect-facebook-with-ad-manager)

  
### Real Estate Facebook Ads Work Best For:

✅ Generating seller leads via home value offers  
✅ Capturing buyer leads via listing previews  
✅ Building brand trust with testimonials and local content

---

### 2.1 Create High-Converting Ad Campaigns

✅ Use listing photos, walkthrough videos, or “Just Listed” posts  
✅ Highlight real testimonials or 5-star Google Reviews  
✅ Promote offers like:

* “Get a Custom Home Valuation”
* “How Much Could Your Home Sell For?”
* “Tour 5 New Listings This Week in \[ZIP\]”

**Targeting Tips:**

* Age 30–65+
* Zip codes around your listings
* Interests: Zillow, real estate investing, home decor

**Example Ad:**  
Offer: “Curious What Your Home Is Worth in Today’s Market?”  
CTA: “Click to Get a Free Personalized Report in 2 Minutes!”

---

### 2.2 Run Retargeting Ads to Convert Window Shoppers

✅ Retarget website visitors who didn’t book a call or fill out the form  
✅ Use urgency (limited-time CMA, early access to off-market homes)  
✅ Focus on listing leads who clicked but didn’t follow through

**Example:**  
“You checked out listings in \[Area\] — still thinking of moving? Let’s chat!”

Ads bring leads. Automation turns them into appointments.

---

✅ Enable Live Chat + SMS Chat  
✅ Capture contact info before visitors leave  
✅ Offer auto-responses like:

* “Want a list of homes under $700K?”
* “Need a quick home value report?”[](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/155000004102-getting-started-with-chat-widget)[](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/155000004102-getting-started-with-chat-widget)

---

## Step 4: Track & Optimize Your Ad ROI

### Why It Matters

What you track = what you scale. Most consultants burn money on ads they don’t measure.

---

### 4.1 Assign Tracking Numbers to Every Ad Campaign

✅ Know which platform brought which lead  
✅ Identify cost per lead and cost per appointment  
✅ Reinvest only in your highest-performing funnels

---

### 4.2 Monitor CPL, Conversion Rate & Booking Rate

✅ Use HighLevel’s dashboards to see:

* Lead source
* Booking source
* Close rate per campaign

**Example:**  
An agent using tracking in Scottsdale cut ad spend by 28% and got 2x the listings by focusing only on top-performing Google ads + FB seller funnel combo.

---
