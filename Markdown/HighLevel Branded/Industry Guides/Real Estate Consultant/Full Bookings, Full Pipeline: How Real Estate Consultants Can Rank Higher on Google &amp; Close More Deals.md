### Are You Losing Leads to Local Competitors?

You're great at helping clients buy, sell, and invest in real estate — but if you're not showing up in search results, you're missing out on qualified leads ready to act now.

**Top Real Estate Challenges We See:**

* You rely on referrals but aren’t consistently getting new calls
* You're spending on Zillow or Google Ads, but it’s hard to track what’s working
* Inquiries go cold before you can respond
* Your competitors are showing up higher on Google and winning listings that should be yours

### Industry Reality:

✅ 97% of home buyers begin their search online  
✅ 70% of sellers contact the first consultant they find online  
✅ Consultants with 50+ Google reviews get 2X more inbound requests than those without

If your real estate business isn't optimized for search, you're leaving listings — and revenue — on the table.

## Step 4: Track What’s Working (and Scale It)

| Metric                     | Why It Matters                          |
| -------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Calls from Google          | Show your GBP impact                    |
| Lead Source Attribution    | Know which blog, ad, or funnel converts |
| Page-to-Booking Conversion | Optimize high-performing pages          |
| Review Growth              | Influence local search rank             |
