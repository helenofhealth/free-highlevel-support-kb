## Why This Playbook Matters

Winning a new real estate client is 5X more expensive than keeping one you already served.  
Yet most consultants chase cold leads, ignoring the repeat clients and referrals that could make their pipeline flow automatically.

  
### Consider These Stats:

✅ 82% of sellers say they’d work with their agent again—yet only 23% actually do (NAR)  
✅ Referral-based clients are 4X more likely to close  
✅ Consultants who stay in touch post-closing generate 37% more listings per year

  
**The problem?** 

Most consultants don’t have a system to stay in touch.

  
**This playbook helps you turn:**  
✅ Every buyer into a future seller  
✅ Every seller into a brand advocate  
✅ Every closing into 2–3 new leads

All without lifting a finger — thanks to HighLevel automation.

## Step 1: Automate Post-Closing Follow-Ups

### Why It Matters

Most consultants close the deal — and then go silent. But follow-up = future business.

**Real Use Case:**  
A Miami consultant set up a “1-year home anniversary” drip in HighLevel. One email led to a referral that landed her next $950K listing.

---

### 1.1 Send a Post-Sale Thank You

✅ Send a warm, personalized message 24–48 hours after closing  
✅ Include: congrats, reminders about the area, and invite to stay in touch  
✅ Use a HighLevel email template and SMS sequence

**Example Message:**  
“Congrats again on your new home, Sarah! It was a pleasure helping you and your family. I’m just a text away if you ever need a contractor, handyman—or decide to upgrade!”

---

### 1.2 Trigger Anniversary Check-Ins

✅ Set up 6-month and 12-month automations  
✅ Include gift ideas, reminders, or even property valuation check-ins

**Example Message:**  
“Hi Sarah, can you believe it’s been a year since you moved into \[Address\]? If you’re curious what your home’s worth now, I’d be happy to run a quick analysis!”

---

## Step 2: Generate 5-Star Reviews on Autopilot

### Why It Matters

More reviews = higher trust = more listings.  
90% of sellers check Google and Zillow before booking a consult.

---

### 2.1 Automate Review Requests

✅ Trigger SMS and email requests as soon as a deal closes  
✅ Personalize by name, address, or experience  
✅ Link to Google, Zillow, and Facebook

**Example Message:**  
“Sarah, working with you was a dream! If you had a great experience, would you mind leaving a quick review? It helps other homeowners find me. Here’s the link: \[Google Review Link\]”

---

### 2.2 Handle Negative Feedback Proactively

✅ Set up AI to flag negative sentiments before they go public  
✅ Auto-respond and prompt a personal call  
✅ Convert unhappy clients into loyal ones with quick fixes

---

## Step 3: Build a Real Estate Referral Engine

### Why It Matters

Referrals are the highest-quality, lowest-cost leads.

✅ They close 4X faster  
✅ Spend less time deciding  
✅ Already trust you

---

### 3.1 Create a Referral Rewards Program

✅ Offer: $250 closing credit, a restaurant gift card, or a donation to charity  
✅ Mention it during your last few client touchpoints  
✅ Automate enrollment via post-closing email

**Example Message:**  
“Know someone buying or selling? Send them my way & I’ll thank you with a $250 closing credit or a gift card of your choice!”

---

### 3.2 Automate Referral Follow-Ups

✅ Auto-email 30 days after closing  
✅ Include the referral link or easy reply CTA  
✅ Track all referrals and apply rewards in HighLevel

---

## Step 4: Offer Property Watch & Seller Re-Engagement Campaigns

### Why It Matters

Sellers take 3–12 months to decide. Staying top-of-mind builds pipeline.

---

### 4.1 Lock in Future Listings with Smart Follow-Ups

✅ Add every past client to a “Home Value Watchlist”  
✅ Send quarterly valuation updates via email or SMS  
✅ Include neighborhood trends, market shifts, etc.

**Example Message:**  
“Your neighbor’s home just sold for $912K — up 8% from last year. Want to know what yours is worth today?”

---

## Step 5: Use AI & Smart Lists to Keep Your Database Working

### Why It Matters

Your past clients are your secret weapon. But most consultants ignore their own goldmine.

---

### 5.1 Smart Segments for Re-Engagement

✅ Build lists based on:

* Property type sold
* Price bracket
* Time since close
* Location

✅ Send seasonal messages, new listings, or “client-only” promos

---

### 5.2 AI-Powered Check-Ins & Satisfaction Surveys

✅ Use AI to message clients after major life events or based on time triggers  
✅ Ask how their home is working out, and if they need anything

**Example Message:**  
“Hi Sarah! Still loving your place? I’d love to check in, and if you’re ever ready for an upgrade, I’ve got off-market gems I’d be happy to show you.”
