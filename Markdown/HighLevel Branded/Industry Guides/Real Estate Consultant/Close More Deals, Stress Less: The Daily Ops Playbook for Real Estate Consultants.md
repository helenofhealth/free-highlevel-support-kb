## Are You Struggling to Juggle Showings, Clients & Follow-Ups?

You’re great at helping clients buy and sell homes—but you didn’t sign up to manage endless admin work.

  
Do any of these sound familiar?

❌ You’re double-booked between a buyer consult and a seller walkthrough  
❌ You lose hot leads because you didn’t follow up fast enough  
❌ Managing documents, showings, and reminders is all over the place  
❌ Clients ghost you after valuation requests  
❌ You can’t tell which leads are serious and which are wasting your time

  
You’re not alone. Most real estate consultants are overwhelmed by the day-to-day—because they’re doing everything manually.

# Step 1: Automate Appointment Booking for Buyers & Sellers

## Why It Matters

72% of real estate clients choose the first consultant who responds.  
Online scheduling boosts appointment conversion rates by 25–30%.

---

### 1.1 Set Up Automated Booking Links

✅ Create separate booking links for:

* Buyer Consultations
* Listing Walkthroughs
* Property Valuations
* Virtual Calls

✅ Embed your booking links:

* In Google Business Profile
* In Instagram link-in-bio
* Inside email/text campaigns

**Use Case**: A first-time buyer clicks your listing ad, lands on your funnel, and books a call instantly without speaking to you—saving time and reducing drop-off.
