## Why This Playbook Matters

It’s not just about being online—it’s about being remembered.

  
With 85% of sellers and 92% of buyers starting their journey online, your content strategy can either drive consistent listings or leave you stuck chasing leads.

But here’s where most consultants fall short:

* They rely only on referrals and ignore brand building.
* They post listings, not solutions.
* They don’t have a repeatable, scalable system to generate content that brings in seller calls or buyer DMs.

  
This playbook gives you the framework to:  
✅ Build authority as a local real estate expert  
✅ Attract leads even when you’re not actively selling  
✅ Create content that moves clients through the sales cycle  
✅ Use HighLevel to automate, scale, and dominate your local market

## Step 1: Understand the Content That Attracts Leads

### Why It Matters

Without structure, posting becomes guesswork. Great content builds credibility and nurtures both buyers and sellers into long-term clients.

---

### 1.1 Four Core Content Types for Real Estate Consultants

| Content Type               | Purpose                             | Example Post                                                   |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Educational                | Build trust, answer questions       | “Should You Buy or Rent in \[City\] in 2025?”                  |
| Engagement-Driven          | Increase reach, start conversations | “Would you rather live downtown or in the suburbs? Comment ⬇️” |
| Promotional                | Drive leads and listings            | “Get Your Home’s Value in 60 Seconds – Free Tool Here”         |
| Social Proof / Credibility | Reinforce your reputation           | “Just Helped a Family Close on Their Dream Home in 3 Weeks!”   |

  
✅ **Pro Tip**: Use the 80/20 Rule  
80% of your content should educate and engage, while 20% promotes a clear CTA (consultation, valuation request, guide download).

---

## Step 2: Pick the Right Platforms (and Use Them Well)

### Why It Matters

Every platform serves a unique role in the buying/selling journey. When you post with intent, your pipeline grows on autopilot.

---

### 2.1 Platform Guide for Real Estate Consultants

| Platform                | Best For                                           | Frequency          |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | ------------------ |
| Facebook                | Listing posts, local trust, testimonials           | 3–5x per week      |
| Instagram               | Visual storytelling, reels, buyer content          | 4–6x per week      |
| LinkedIn                | Investor, referral & relocation leads              | 2–3x per week      |

| Blog/Newsletter         | SEO, market updates, email nurture                 | 2–4x per month     |
| Offline                 | Flyers, QR codes, yard signs, local magazine       | Seasonal Campaigns |

  
✅ **Pro Tip**: Agents who update their GBP weekly get 2X the call volume from Google Maps & local searches.

## Step 3: Create Content That Converts

### Why It Matters

Content is sales at scale—when structured correctly.

---

### 3.1 The Real Estate Hook–Value–Action Formula

✅ **Hook**: “Thinking about selling your home in \[City\]?”  
✅ **Value**: “Here are 3 things to do now to get top dollar in 2024.”  
✅ **CTA**: “DM me ‘SELL’ and I’ll send you my 15-step seller checklist.”

---

### 3.2 Content Strategy Examples

| Content Type | Headline                                                  | CTA                                    |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Educational  | “How to Buy with 5% Down in Today’s Market”               | “Get my First-Time Buyer Toolkit”      |
| Engagement   | “Would you rather a home office or bigger kitchen?”       | “Vote in the comments!”                |
| Promotional  | “We Just Listed a 3BR in \[Neighborhood\] – See Photos”   | “Click here to book a showing”         |
| Social Proof | “Closed! Helped Sarah go from renter to owner in 45 days” | “Want to be next? DM me for a consult” |

---

## Step 4: Track What Works (and Fix What Doesn’t)

### Why It Matters

If you don’t know what’s working, you can’t scale. HighLevel’s analytics let you see exactly which posts drive clicks, bookings, and revenue.

---

### 4.1 Key Content Metrics to Monitor

| Metric               | What It Tells You                            |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Engagement Rate      | Are people connecting with your content?     |
| Link Clicks/CTR      | Is your CTA strong enough to drive action?   |
| Form Submissions     | Are you converting views into leads?         |
| Lead Source Tracking | Which content channel delivers the best ROI? |
| Booking Rate         | What % of content leads convert to consults? |

✅ **Pro Tip**: Real estate businesses that follow up within 10 mins of a lead converting are 8X more likely to close.
