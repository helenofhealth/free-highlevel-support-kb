## **Why Content Still Matters (And Always Will)**

Your clients are scrolling between appointments. Instagram, TikTok, Google, Yelp — it’s all part of the new word-of-mouth. And the salons that show up consistently? They stay top of mind.

But here’s the truth: posting randomly when you remember doesn’t cut it. You need a system — one that’s simple, repeatable, and designed to grow your salon’s brand _and_ bookings.

This playbook gives you that system.

> **91% of beauty clients check a salon’s Instagram or reviews before booking — and 64% say a “strong online vibe” influenced their choice.**

## **Step 1: Choose Your Content Pillars**

Let’s keep it focused. Pick 3–4 main categories of content that you can post every week without burning out.

### Beauty Salon Content Pillars:

1. **Before & Afters** — hair transformations, facials, brows
2. **Behind the Scenes** — staff moments, prep rituals, salon setups
3. **Client Testimonials** — review screenshots, video feedback
4. **Promos & Offers** — limited-time discounts, holiday specials

Optional additions:

* Educational tips (“Why exfoliation matters for glow”)
* Seasonal content (“Spring Hair Trends”)
* UGC reposts (with permission)

Choose 4–5 categories and cycle through them weekly.

---

## **Step 2: Build a 30-Day Posting Schedule**

Use this high-converting pattern:

| Day | Content Type                |
| --- | --------------------------- |
| Mon | Before/After or Testimonial |
| Tue | Tip or Educational Reel     |
| Wed | Promo or Special Offer      |
| Thu | Behind the Scenes           |
| Fri | Client Quote + Call to Book |
| Sat | Trending Sound or UGC       |
| Sun | Optional / No Post          |

That’s 5–6 posts a week — totally manageable with batching.

You can repeat the same structure next month with fresh visuals.

## **Step 3: Design Posts That Actually Perform**

### Instagram Feed:

* Use clean backgrounds
* Always include a call to action (CTA)
* Add location tags and relevant hashtags

### Reels:

* Use trending audio with captions on screen
* Start with a hook (“From dull to glow in one facial…”)
* Show transformation within 3 seconds

### Stories:

* Share live bookings, client arrivals, BTS
* Use polls ("Which brow shape would you choose?")
* Add a link sticker to your booking calendar

> **Reels have 2x the reach of regular photo posts — and salons that post Reels 3x/week grow 4x faster on Instagram.**

**[How to Use the Social Planner](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/155000005063-getting-started-setup-social-planner)**

Batch content 1x a week or biweekly. Set it. Forget it. Watch your brand stay visible.

---

## **Step 5: Repurpose Like a Pro**

Turn one client story into:

* A feed post (“Jessica’s glow-up after our signature facial”)
* A Reel (video of her before/after)
* A Story with poll (“Would you try this?”)
* A Testimonial graphic for your website or Google review highlight

You don’t need 30 ideas. You need 5 that become 30 assets.

---

## **Step 6: Review What’s Working**

Each week, review:

* Most liked/shared posts
* Reels with highest reach
* Booking clicks from IG bio link or Story link stickers
* DMs started from promo posts

This helps you double down on the formats that work.

> **Instagram insights show 3x higher clickthrough rates on stories that include “Book Now” or “Swipe Up” CTAs.**

## **Final Words: Post With Purpose, Not Pressure**

Content should work _for_ you — not drain you.

When your content system runs like clockwork, you stay top of mind, look booked and professional, and attract clients who already feel connected.
