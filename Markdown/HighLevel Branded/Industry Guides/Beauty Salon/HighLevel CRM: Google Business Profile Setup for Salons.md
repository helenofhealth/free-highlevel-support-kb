**Important:** Your Name, Address, Phone (NAP) must match your website, Facebook, Instagram bios, Yelp, and everywhere else.

### **4\. Write a Dreamy, Beauty-First Salon Description**

**Formula for your salon description:**

* Highlight Signature Services (Hair Color, Bridal Makeup, Luxury Facials)
* Showcase Unique Selling Points (award-winning stylists, organic products, celebrity clients)

**Interactive Tip:** Write down your salon’s top 3 strengths. Use them in your description.

* Interior: Chairs, mirrors, vibe shots
* Staff in Action: Styling, makeup, facials (with permission)
* Product Display: Premium beauty brands
* Client Transformations: Before and after (with signed client consent)

**Tip:** Bright, clean, smiling photos outperform dark or cluttered shots.
