## **Why Reviews and Reactivation Are Your Secret Growth Channels**

  
You can be the best stylist, brow artist, or skin expert in town — but if your Google listing shows 3 reviews from 2021, it doesn’t matter. Clients trust word of mouth, and in today’s world, that “word” shows up as a glowing 5-star rating.

On the other end, your old clients? They’re just sitting there — untouched, unbooked, unprompted. Most aren’t gone forever. They’ve just been _neglected_.

This playbook will help you:

* Turn every happy appointment into a public 5-star review
* Build automations that make reviews roll in without awkward asking
* Win back lapsed clients and no-shows through strategic reactivation flows

## **Step 1: Automate the Ask — Reviews Without the Awkwardness**

  
Every single happy client should be nudged (gently, automatically) to leave a review within 1–2 hours of their visit.

### Here’s how:

1. Create a post-appointment workflow in GHL
2. Add a trigger: “Appointment marked as completed”
3. Add a 1-hour delay
4. Send a short SMS or email like:

**Text Template:** “Hey \[First Name\], we loved having you in today! If you’re happy with your glow-up, we’d be so grateful for a quick review. It helps others find us and keeps us shining ✨ \[Review Link\]”

1. Include a **direct Google review link** (not your homepage!)

## **Step 2: Show Off Your Glow — Display Reviews Onsite and On Auto**

  
Once those glowing reviews start coming in, you want them working for you 24/7 — not just buried on your Google page.

### Do this:

* Add a live review widget to your website or booking funnel
* Feature the most recent 5 reviews
* Bonus: Add photos or highlight reels with UGC or testimonials

**Example:** Add a section on your facial service page with a headline like:

> “Real Clients. Real Glow-Ups.” ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ “The best facial I’ve had in my life. The ambiance, the hands, the results? 10/10.” – Jane

## **Step 3: Reactivate Clients Who’ve Gone Quiet**

  
Your regulars from last year? The ones who loved your deep-clean facials or always came for brow tinting before holidays? They're not lost. They're just waiting for a nudge.

### Build a Reactivation Workflow

**Start by segmenting clients based on time since last visit:**

* 30 days
* 60 days
* 90+ days

Use smart lists or custom fields to trigger targeted messages.

**Sample Message Flow:**

> “Hey \[Name\], it’s been a while since your last visit to \[Salon Name\] — how about a little pick-me-up? Book this week and get a free under-eye mask with your facial ?‍♀️”

You can:

* Offer a small gift (add-on service, ₹200 off)
* Include a direct booking link
* Set urgency with “This week only” or “Last 5 slots”

## **Step 4: Bring Back the No-Shows — Gracefully**

  
No-shows don’t always mean lost clients. Sometimes they forgot. Sometimes life got in the way.

### Here’s how to handle it:

* Create a separate pipeline stage or tag: “No-Show”
* Build a 2-step workflow:  
   1. First message: A warm check-in 2 hours post missed appointment  
         * “Hey \[Name\], we missed you today! Everything okay? Want to reschedule?”  
   2. Second message 24 hours later with a reschedule link and bonus:  
         * “We totally understand! If you rebook this week, we’d love to gift you a 10-minute head massage on the house ?”

Make it easy. Make it warm. Make it worth coming back.

## **Step 5: Track Your Reputation Like You Track Your Appointments**

  
Inside your GHL dashboard, go to the **Reputation Tab**. Here, you can:

* See how many new reviews came in this week
* View star ratings, sentiment breakdown, and response rates
* Reply to reviews directly (never let one sit unanswered)

Make this part of your weekly routine. 5 minutes on Friday = lifetime value.

## **Final Words: Reviews Build Trust. Reactivation Builds Revenue.**

This isn’t just about stars and systems. It’s about creating momentum.

One review brings another. One win-back message rebooks a client. One smooth reactivation fills a day that would’ve been empty.

You already deliver the service. Now let your systems keep the conversation going.
