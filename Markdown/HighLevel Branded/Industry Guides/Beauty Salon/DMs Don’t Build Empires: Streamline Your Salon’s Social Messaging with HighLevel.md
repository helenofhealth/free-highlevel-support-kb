## **Why Messaging Matters More Than Ever**

You post. They tap. They DM. And then what?

If your DMs are scattered between Instagram, Facebook, and the occasional text, it’s no wonder replies fall through the cracks — or take too long. In a beauty business where clients expect fast, friendly responses, your inbox is your first impression.

This playbook helps you centralize your social messages using HighLevel, so you can book faster, reply smarter, and stop relying on screenshots or team group chats.

> 74% of local service clients said they booked with the business that replied to their inquiry within the first hour.

## **Step 1: Connect Instagram and Facebook to HighLevel**

Instead of logging into multiple apps, link your salon’s Facebook and Instagram Business accounts directly to GHL.

### This lets you:

* See all IG and FB messages in one place (the “Conversations” tab)
* Reply to comments and DMs from your desktop or phone
* Tag and track incoming leads directly from social

## **Step 2: Streamline Your Inbox Workflow**

Once messages come in, treat them like leads — not noise.

### Here’s the system:

* Use **Quick Replies** for FAQs like “What are your prices?” or “Where are you located?”
* Tag clients based on interest (“Hair Color Lead,” “Facial Promo DM”)
* Trigger automation from DM entries (“Hey, I want to book a facial” starts a workflow with link to your calendar)

> Businesses that use message templates reduce first-response time by over 60%.

## **Step 3: Automate Replies Outside Business Hours**

No one expects a midnight facial reply. But they _do_ appreciate instant acknowledgement.

Set up an auto-responder for messages received outside of business hours:

> “Hey gorgeous! We got your message. Our front desk is offline but we’ll reply first thing tomorrow. In the meantime, you can book here: \[link\]”

This keeps them warm and engaged until you reply manually.

## **Step 4: Use GHL Mobile App to Stay Responsive On-the-Go**

Install the GHL mobile app so you or your front desk team can:

* Reply to DMs and text messages on the fly
* Book appointments directly from chat
* Add new leads from social into your CRM instantly

## **Step 5: Track, Tag, and Convert More Social Leads**

Don’t just reply. Track what happens next.

### Use Pipelines + Tags:

* Every new social DM lead enters your “Social Leads” pipeline
* Apply tags like “FB DM – Bridal Trial” or “IG Promo – Skin Glow”
* Assign follow-up tasks (e.g., “Text booking link if no reply in 24 hrs”)

This turns social into a real client acquisition engine — not just a chat thread.
