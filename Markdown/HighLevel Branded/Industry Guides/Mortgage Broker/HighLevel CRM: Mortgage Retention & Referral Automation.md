## **[](https://www.gohighlevel.com/?utm%5Fsource=SEO&utm%5Fmedium=Organic&utm%5Fcampaign=Real+Estate&utm%5Fterm=Mortgage+Broker&utm%5Fcontent=Playbook)Why This Playbook Matters**

Acquiring a new borrower costs **5x more** than retaining a past client.  
Yet, many mortgage brokers are hyper-focused on lead generation while **ignoring their #1 asset**—**satisfied past clients**.

Every successful closing should lead to:

* At least one referral
* Long-term refinancing or investment conversations
* A steady stream of repeat business from their sphere

But instead, most brokers:

* Lose touch after closing
* Miss refinance and upsell opportunities
* Leave reviews and referrals up to chance
* Let competitors swoop in when it’s time to refi

This playbook fixes all of that.

We'll show you how to **automate follow-ups, get 5-star reviews, generate warm referrals, and lock in long-term borrower relationships** using **HighLevel**—without chasing or micromanaging.

## **What You'll Learn**

✅ How to stay top of mind after closing with automated check-ins  
✅ How to turn every funded loan into a 5-star review + referral  
✅ How to set up annual mortgage check-ins & refinance alerts  
✅ How to use AI to prevent churn and re-engage cold borrowers

## **Step 1: Automate Post-Close Follow-Ups**

### Why It Matters

72% of borrowers never hear from their broker again after closing.

✅ Problem: You close the loan and move on.  
✅ Result: 3 years later, they refinance with Quicken or Rocket because _they_ followed up.  
✅ Solution: HighLevel follow-up automations keep you in front of past clients—so you win repeat business without lifting a finger.

### **1.1 Post-Close Thank You & Check-In**

Send an automated thank-you SMS or email after funding:

* Express gratitude
* Reinforce next steps (e.g., first payment date, support line)
* Encourage reaching out for future real estate/mortgage needs

**Example**:  
"Hey Sarah, congrats on closing your loan with us! ? It was a pleasure working with you. Let me know if you ever need a referral for a contractor, agent, or want to explore investment options!"

**Set this up once in HighLevel — and it goes out automatically after every closing.**

---

### **1.2 Annual Mortgage Check-Ins**

Set up 6, 12, and 24-month check-ins with past clients.

Examples:

* “Interest rates dropped — want to run a quick refinance scenario?”
* “Thinking about buying a second property or pulling equity for renovations?”

**Example**:  
"Hi Mike, it’s been a year since you closed with us. Want me to run a quick rate check? Could save you $$ if a refi makes sense."

**Pro Tip**: Use Smart Lists in HighLevel to segment clients by loan type (FHA, VA, Jumbo) and trigger the most relevant offer.

---

## **Step 2: Turn Every Loan Into a 5-Star Review**

### Why It Matters

Brokers with 50+ positive Google reviews get **up to 3x more calls** from local buyers & agents.

Yet, most brokers are afraid to “ask” or just forget.

---

### **2.1 Automate Review Requests**

Set HighLevel to send a review link 2 days after funding:

* SMS + email
* Personalized with their name + the agent’s name
* Link to Google, Zillow, and Facebook

**Example**:  
"Sarah, thank you again for trusting us! It’d mean the world if you could leave a quick review. It helps other buyers find a trusted lender like you did! Here’s the link: \[Review Link\]"

**HighLevel handles all of it**—trigger, message, tracking, and reminders.

---

### **2.2 Catch Negative Feedback Before It Becomes Public**

Use AI-powered review filtering:

* If a client is unsatisfied, HighLevel routes them to a feedback form
* Automatically notify your team for a live call resolution
* Reduce your public negative review risk

---

## **Step 3: Build a Referral Engine (Without Begging)**

### Why It Matters

Referrals convert 5x faster and close **22% more often** than cold leads.  
Your happiest clients are also connected to **other buyers, sellers, and agents**—you just need a system to tap into that.

---

### **3.1 Launch a Mortgage Referral Program**

Set up a simple referral offer like:

* "$100 gift card for any client you send our way who closes"
* Or, "Free appraisal credit for referred clients"

**Example Message**:  
"Sarah, if you know anyone looking to buy or refinance, we’d love to help—and we’ll send you a $100 gift card as a thank-you!"

Set up automated referral messages 2 weeks post-closing using HighLevel’s Workflows.

---

### **3.2 Track & Automate Referral Follow-Ups**

* Use tags like “Referrer: John Smith”
* Automatically reward both parties after closing
* Trigger bonus follow-ups with personalized thank-you notes

**Example**:  
"Sarah, thanks for referring Mike! We just closed his loan—and your $100 Amazon card is on the way! Really appreciate the trust."

---

## **Step 4: Lock in Long-Term Relationships with Mortgage Health Reviews**

### Why It Matters

Rates change. Life happens. Clients forget who helped them last time.

But YOU should be the one offering:

* Refi advice
* Investment loan consultations
* Equity-based renovation options

---

### **4.1 Offer Annual Mortgage Check-Ups**

Like a dentist does cleanings, you should offer "loan reviews":

12 months post-close:  
"Want to know if you're still in the best mortgage for your needs? Let’s do a free 15-min mortgage check-up."

Include loan balance, interest rate, and goals—automatically pulled into email/SMS with HighLevel custom values.

---

### **4.2 Promote Investment Property Loans or HELOCs**

Re-engage past clients based on home equity growth and property value triggers.

Examples:

* “Use your equity for upgrades—ask us about a cash-out refinance.”
* “Thinking of investing in a rental? We can pre-approve you in minutes.”

Set Smart Lists in HighLevel to auto-tag past clients based on duration since close, property type, or ZIP code.

---

## **Step 5: Use AI + Smart Lists to Scale Engagement Without Lifting a Finger**

### Why It Matters

Reactivating a past client is **10x easier and cheaper** than acquiring a new one.

But no broker has time to chase every old file. HighLevel does it for you.

---

### **5.1 Create Smart Lists of Past Clients**

Segment by:

* Purchase vs. Refi
* Agent referral source
* Loan anniversary
* Equity eligibility

Send:

* Rate drop alerts
* Home value updates
* Refi calculators
* Free mortgage health review invites

---

### **5.2 Use Conversation AI to Re-Engage**

Let HighLevel’s AI:

* Text your past clients
* Respond to questions instantly
* Book appointments for mortgage reviews

**Example Message**:  
"Hi Sarah! Mortgage rates just dipped. Want to see if you could save $200/month by refinancing? I can run a quick scenario."

If they reply "Yes," the AI books them directly into your calendar.
