### Why This Playbook Matters

You’re an expert in guiding borrowers, structuring deals, and closing loans—but how do you keep a consistent flow of inbound leads, nurture relationships, and grow your business predictably?

Most mortgage brokers still rely heavily on agent referrals or past clients, but here’s the reality:

* **88% of borrowers start their home loan journey online.**
* **78% of prospects go with the first broker or lender who responds.**
* **61% of homebuyers say slow communication is the #1 reason they don't work with a broker.**

If you're not showing up on Google, following up fast, or staying top-of-mind with digital marketing—your competition is winning the loans you should be closing.

This playbook gives you a **step-by-step system** to launch and grow your brokerage with **HighLevel**—so you attract, convert, and retain more borrowers.
