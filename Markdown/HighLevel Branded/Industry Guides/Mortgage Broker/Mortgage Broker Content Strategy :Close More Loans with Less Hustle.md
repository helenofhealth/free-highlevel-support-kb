## Why This Playbook Matters

82% of homebuyers start their mortgage journey online before speaking to a broker. If your content isn’t showing up in their feed, inbox, or search results—you’re losing deals before they even reach out.

  
Most brokers:

* Rely on referrals but aren’t consistently top-of-mind.
* Post sporadically without a strategic plan.
* Don’t know which content actually converts browsers into borrowers.
* Fail to leverage automation to stay visible 24/7.

  
This playbook will help you fix that by giving you a **clear, tested roadmap** to:

✅ Build local trust and stand out from competitors  
✅ Capture high-intent homebuyer and refinance leads  
✅ Nurture long-term relationships for repeat/referral business  
✅ Automate content, follow-ups, and visibility—so you close more, with less work

## Step 1: Know the Content That Drives Leads

### Why It Matters

Posting randomly isn’t a strategy. A structured content system ensures you attract and convert serious buyers, investors, and refinance clients.

### 1.1 The Four Core Content Types

| Content Type          | Purpose                                                | Example                                               |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| **Educational**       | Build trust by simplifying complex mortgage concepts   | “Fixed vs. Adjustable Rates: What’s Right for You?”   |
| **Engagement-Driven** | Boost reach and visibility through interaction         | “What’s your biggest fear about getting a mortgage?”  |
| **Promotional**       | Highlight services & offers that generate direct leads | “Free 15-min Pre-Approval Consult — This Week Only!”  |
| **Social Proof**      | Showcase real wins to build credibility                | “Helped Sarah save $12K by refinancing her FHA loan!” |

> **Pro Tip:** Use the **80/20 Rule** → 80% value / 20% direct pitch

## Step 2: Platform-Specific Strategy

### Why It Matters

Every platform attracts different parts of your audience. Tailor your content to each one.

| Platform                         | Best Content                                  | Frequency             |
| -------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | --------------------- |
| **Facebook**                     | Testimonials, short videos, Q&A, promos       | 3–5x per week         |
| **Instagram**                    | Reels, homeownership tips, lifestyle posts    | 5–7x per week         |
| **LinkedIn**                     | B2B partnerships, market insights             | 2–3x per week         |
| **YouTube**                      | Deep-dive explainers, market trend videos     | 1–2x per week         |
| **TikTok**                       | Fast tips, myths vs. facts, behind the scenes | 3–5x per week         |
| **Google Business Profile**      | Offers, client success, reviews               | 2–4x per month        |
| **Blog / Email**                 | Market updates, case studies                  | 2x per month          |
| **Offline (flyers/newsletters)** | Rates, team highlights, promos                | Quarterly or seasonal |

  
**Metric**: Businesses that post 3–5x/week on social convert 2–3x more leads than those who post less.

## Step 3: Create High-Converting Content

### Why It Matters

Great content has a structure: **Hook + Value + Call-to-Action.**

  
### 3.1 Winning Content Formula

**Hook:** “Think rates are too high to buy a home?”  
**Value:** “You might qualify for a 3% down first-time buyer program.”  
**CTA:** “DM me for a 60-second prequal check.”

### 3.2 Example Posts by Type

| Post Type        | Headline                                                               | CTA                                        |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| **Educational**  | “Confused by mortgage points? Here’s how they can save you thousands.” | “Book a free mortgage strategy session.”   |
| **Engagement**   | “What was your first home interest rate? Comment below!”               | “We’ll share results in a follow-up post!” |
| **Promotional**  | “Rates Dropped Today! Check your buying power with no credit pull.”    | “Text ‘RATE’ to 55555 to start.”           |
| **Social Proof** | “Just closed a $1.2M loan in 11 days with no delays.”                  | “Read more success stories on our site.”   |

## Step 4: Measure & Optimize

### Why It Matters

If you don’t track it, you can’t scale it.

  
| Metric                 | What It Tells You                 |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| **Engagement Rate**    | Are people interacting?           |
| **Click-Through Rate** | Are they taking action?           |
| **Conversion Rate**    | Are they becoming leads or calls? |
| **Lead Response Time** | Are you following up fast enough? |

> ✅ Brokers who respond within **5 minutes** of a lead converting are **9x more likely to close**.
