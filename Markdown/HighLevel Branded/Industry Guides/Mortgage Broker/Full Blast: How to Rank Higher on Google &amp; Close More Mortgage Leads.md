**Are Borrowers Finding Your Competitors First?**  
  
You’re great at guiding clients through financing—home loans, pre-approvals, refinancing, or first-time buyers. But are you consistently getting inbound leads _without_ chasing agents or burning money on ads?

Many mortgage professionals struggle with:

* Inconsistent deal flow and referral droughts
* Complicated lead follow-ups that fall through the cracks
* Losing top search spots to big-name lenders
* Wasting ad spend without knowing what’s working

**Stat Check**: 72% of borrowers only apply with one lender—typically the _first one_ they find online.

If you’re not ranking high on Google and automating follow-ups, you’re leaving deals on the table.

## **What If You Had a System That Worked While You Slept?**

Picture this:

* Your mortgage business ranks at the top of Google for “mortgage broker near me”
* Borrowers book consults 24/7—no cold calls or chasing
* Automated systems follow up instantly so no deal slips away
* You track every click, call, and loan app to know exactly what converts

This playbook shows you exactly how to:  
✅ Rank higher on Google  
✅ Capture more borrower leads  
✅ Automate follow-ups  
✅ Track everything  
✅ Convert more consultations into funded deals

## **Step 1: Optimize Your Google Business Profile for Local Borrowers**

### Why It Matters?

97% of home loan borrowers search online before choosing a mortgage provider.  
And 68% of mobile searches for “mortgage broker near me” result in a call within 24 hours.

  
### 1.1 Set Up & Optimize Your Google Business Profile (GMB)

* Make sure your **business name, phone, and address** are identical across your website, listings, and social pages.
* Add keywords like:  
→ “First-time homebuyer loans”  
→ “Refinance in \[City\]”  
→ “FHA loan help”
* Upload headshots, closings, and photos from client success stories

**Pro Tip**: Add FAQ content to GMB like “What documents do I need for a pre-approval?”

### 1.2 Enable Google Messaging & Call Tracking

* Let prospects text you directly from search
* Use **HighLevel’s call tracking numbers** so you know which campaigns and locations generate the most calls

Example: “5 buyers booked a call last week through your ‘Pre-Approval in 24 Hours’ GMB post.”

## **Step 2: Convert More Website Visitors Into Leads**

### Why It Matters

Most mortgage websites leak leads—slow load times, poor CTAs, and no follow-up.

[Sites Overview](https://help.gohighlevel.com/en/support/solutions/articles/155000001633)

  
### 2.1 Use Mortgage-Specific SEO

Embed local mortgage search terms in:

* Homepage title: “Top Mortgage Broker in \[City\] | Pre-Approvals in 24 Hours”
* Service pages: “VA Loan Specialist in \[City\]” / “FHA Mortgage Help”
* Blogs: “Should I Buy or Wait in 2025?” or “How to Get Pre-Approved Fast”

**Example**: Rank blog posts answering common questions like “Is now a good time to refinance?”

* “Book a Free Consultation”
* “Check My Rates”
* “Get Pre-Approved Now”

Tools to Add:

* Lead form pop-ups
* Chat widget (HighLevel’s AI bot answers instantly)

## **Step 3: Speed, Mobile, & Trust = Better SEO Rankings**

### 3.1 Speed Up Your Site

* Google drops slow mortgage sites down the rankings
* Compress images, remove bloated plugins, and use **HighLevel’s fast funnel/website builder**

### 3.2 Add Mortgage Schema Markup (Structured Data)

* Schema tells Google what your site is about
* Add “Mortgage Broker” or “Loan Officer” schema to show up in rich search results

Example: Show up as a “Top Mortgage Expert in \[City\]” with review stars and business hours in the search result snippet
