## **Why This Playbook Matters**

Most mortgage brokers depend too heavily on real estate agent referrals and outdated lead vendors, leaving their pipeline dry in slow months. But today’s borrowers start their mortgage journey **online**—often _before_ they speak to a lender.

**Key Mortgage Industry Stats:**

* 93% of borrowers research mortgage options online before engaging a lender
* 70% of millennials say they would switch lenders for a better digital experience
* Brokers who run digital ads generate **3.5x more applications** than those who rely solely on referrals

If you’re not advertising on Google, Facebook, or Instagram—your competition is. This playbook will help you change that, using smart, automated, data-backed campaigns.

## **Step 1: Get Found by Motivated Borrowers with Google Ads**

### **Why It Matters**

When borrowers are ready to apply, they go to Google first.  
60% of mortgage customers apply with the first lender they engage. If you don’t appear on page one, you’re invisible.

---

### **1.1 Run Google Local & Search Ads**

✅ Appear for searches like:

* “Best mortgage broker near me”
* “First-time homebuyer mortgage \[City\]”
* “Refinance FHA loan now”

✅ Target high-intent categories:

* Conventional, FHA, VA, Jumbo
* Cash-out refi, HELOC
* Investment / DSCR / Bank statement loans

**Pro Tip:** Use keywords with urgency:

* “Pre-approval in 24 hrs”
* “Lock your rate today”
* “Refi before Fed hike”

**Example:**  
A broker running Google Ads for “No-Doc Refi in Texas” landed 32 funded loans in 60 days with a $42 CPL using a HighLevel landing page and CRM flow.

---

### **1.2 Use Call Tracking on All Campaigns**

✅ Assign a unique number to each ad group  
✅ Capture & respond to missed calls instantly with HighLevel automation  
✅ Attribute every closed deal to the source

  
**Example:**  
Your VA loan campaign has double the lead volume of your FHA refi campaign. With call tracking, you’ll see it—so you scale that campaign and increase ROI.

## **Step 2: Reach Refi Leads & Buyers with Facebook & Instagram Ads**

### **Why It Matters**

Many buyers aren’t searching—yet. But they’re on social, watching for advice, calculators, and current rate offers.

Facebook ads generate mortgage leads for **$10–$30 each**, with lower competition than Google.

### **2.1 Create Trust-Building Ads**

✅ Promote:

* Free first-time buyer checklists
* Mortgage calculators & instant quote tools
* Client success stories & fast-funding cases

**Ad Targeting:**

* Location: Zip codes you serve

---

### **2.2 Use Retargeting Ads to Recover Abandoned Leads**

✅ Remarket to website visitors & dropped leads  
✅ Show urgency-based offers (“Rates dropped—lock in 48 hrs”)  
✅ Drive re-engagement with dynamic ads

  
**Example Ad:**  
“Still exploring mortgage options? We saved your info—complete your pre-approval today and skip upfront fees.”

---

### **2.3 Automate All Follow-Ups from Social Leads**

✅ Every lead goes into HighLevel CRM  
✅ Trigger instant text + email drip campaigns  
✅ AI chatbot books consults automatically

  
**Example:**  
Borrower clicks on your “Pre-Approval in 60 Seconds” Facebook ad. HighLevel triggers:

* SMS: “Hi Sam! Want us to run your numbers now?”
* AI chatbot handles FAQs
* Calendar link to schedule a call with your loan officer

  
**Result:** 40% more leads converted by responding faster than competitors.

## **Step 3: Capture Every Lead with On-Site & Offline Tools**

### **Why It Matters**

Your website’s bounce rate is likely over 80%. Without a chat widget or fast CTA, you’re losing deals daily.

---

### **3.1 Use Chat Widget + Smart Forms**

✅ Install Live Chat with AI mortgage bot  
✅ Ask:

* Name, loan type, ZIP code, budget, credit tier  
✅ Offer instant quotes or call scheduling

  
**Example CTA:**  
“Want a no-credit-pull rate quote? Let’s get started below.”[](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/155000004102-getting-started-with-chat-widget)

---

### **3.2 Use Text-to-Lead & QR Codes**

✅ Run SMS-based ads or offline capture:

* “Text HOME to 88888 to get today’s rates”  
✅ Add QR codes to business cards, open house flyers, signage  
✅ HighLevel sends auto responses with links + follow-up drip

---

## **Step 4: Track What Works & Optimize for ROI**

### **Why It Matters**

30%+ of ad spend is wasted when brokers can’t see what drives actual funded loans.

---

### **4.1 Assign Unique Tracking Numbers**

✅ Create a different number for:

* First-time buyer campaigns
* HELOC/refi campaigns
* Realtor/builder referrals

✅ See exactly where each lead came from

---

### **4.2 Monitor Key Metrics Daily**

✅ CPL (cost per lead)  
✅ CPA (cost per application)  
✅ CPF (cost per funded deal)  
✅ Time-to-first-contact (speed to lead)

  
**Example:**

| Campaign       | CPL | Apps Funded | CPF  |
| -------------- | --- | ----------- | ---- |
| FHA First-Time | $28 | 16          | $112 |
| Facebook Refi  | $17 | 8           | $81  |

  
Shift more spend to Facebook Refi—lower cost per deal.
