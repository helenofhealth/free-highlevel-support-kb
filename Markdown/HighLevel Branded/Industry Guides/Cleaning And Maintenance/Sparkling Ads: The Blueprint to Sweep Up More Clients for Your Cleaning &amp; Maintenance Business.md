### **Step 1: Get Found with Google Ads & Local Services Ads**

#### **Why It Matters?**

#### When customers need cleaning services, the **first place they go is Google.**  
✅ **70% of customers** hire a provider who shows up in the first **five search results**.  
✅ **Google Local Services Ads (LSA)** deliver **leads, not clicks**, making them **highly cost-effective**.  
✅ The **average cost per lead (CPL) for cleaning businesses** on Google Ads is **$15 - $50**, but can be **lower with proper targeting**.

####   

#### **1.1 Set Up Google Local Services Ads (LSA)**

* #### Appear at the **top of Google search results** for searches like **“House Cleaning Near Me”** or **“Office Janitorial Services.”**
* #### **Pay only for valid leads**—not just clicks.
* #### Get **Google Guaranteed certification** (boosts conversion rates by **30%**).
* #### Target **high-intent service categories** like **Deep Cleaning, Move-In/Move-Out Cleaning, Commercial Cleaning.**

#### **Example:**  
A cleaning business running **LSA ads** for "Move-Out Cleaning" sees **higher-intent leads** and **30-40% close rates**.
