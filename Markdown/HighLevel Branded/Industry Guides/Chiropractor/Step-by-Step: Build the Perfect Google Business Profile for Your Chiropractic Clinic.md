### **Why This Matters More Than You Think**

Imagine someone in your area searches “chiropractor near me” because they’ve just pulled their back or are struggling with neck pain. You could be the perfect provider. But if your Google listing isn’t optimized — or worse, doesn’t exist — that patient is going to call your competitor instead.

Your **Google Business Profile (GBP)** is your clinic’s digital front door. It’s often the _first impression_ you make — before a patient ever visits your website, books online, or picks up the phone.

This guide walks you through exactly how to set up a high-converting, trust-building, appointment-generating GBP — tailored for chiropractors.

### **1\. Claim or Create Your Google Business Profile**

Head to [Google Business Profile Manager](https://business.google.com/in/business-profile/?ppsrc=GPDA2).

* Log in using a professional email (ideally tied to your clinic’s domain).
* Search your clinic’s name.  
   * If it exists: **Claim it immediately**.  
   * If it doesn’t: **Create a new one** using your official clinic name.

> Keep your clinic name clean and consistent. No added keywords like "Best Chiropractor in \[City\]."

Think of this step as claiming your piece of digital real estate — one that patients are actively searching.

### **2\. Choose the Right Business Categories**

Your **Primary Category** defines your core service:

* **Chiropractor** _(Select only one primary category)_

Add **Secondary Categories** to help Google better understand your services:

* Sports Injury Clinic
* Wellness Center
* Pain Control Clinic
* Massage Therapist _(only if offered onsite)_
* Physical Therapy Clinic

> Don’t guess — be strategic. Adding irrelevant categories can confuse the algorithm and hurt your ranking.

### **3\. Get Your Business Info Right (NAP Consistency)**

Google values **consistency** across all your listings. Your name, address, and phone number (NAP) should match _exactly_ on your website, Facebook, directories, and here.

Checklist:

* **Name**: Exactly as seen on your signage and site
* **Address**: Pinned correctly on Google Maps
* **Phone**: Use your business line, not a personal number
* **Website**: Ideally links to your GHL booking page
* **Hours**: Double check — out-of-date hours kill trust

> Matching your NAP across all platforms builds authority and trust with Google — which boosts your local ranking.

Edit your business description

### **4\. Write a Compelling Chiropractic Clinic Description**

This is where your story meets search.

Use this simple format:

* Who you help
* What you specialize in
* What makes you different
* Where you’re located

**Example:** "At Axis Spine & Wellness, we help busy professionals, athletes, and families relieve pain and restore balance through tailored chiropractic care. From spinal adjustments to injury rehab, our Plano clinic delivers expert, patient-centered treatments."

Your description isn’t just for patients — Google reads it too. Add relevant keywords naturally (like your city name, your specialties, or pain relief terms).

---

### **5\. Upload Photos That Build Trust**

You wouldn’t walk into a clinic that looks dark, cluttered, or impersonal — and neither would your patients. Your photos need to reflect the _real_, welcoming energy of your practice.

Post high-quality images of:

* **Exterior**: So patients recognize your clinic from the street
* **Interior**: Clean, bright treatment and waiting areas
* **Team**: Friendly, confident faces of your staff
* **Action**: Adjustments, consults, or therapy (with permission)
* **Tools & Equipment**: Modern tech = credibility

> Listings with photos get 42% more direction requests and 35% more clicks. First impressions matter — online and off.

### **6\. List Out Your Services and Pricing (if applicable)**

Your prospective patients want clarity: What do you do, and what does it cost?

Examples:

* New Patient Exam – $49
* Spinal Adjustment – $60
* Sports Injury Rehab – $75
* Prenatal Chiropractic – $70

Adding your services not only helps people choose you — it also gives Google more data to rank you higher in relevant searches.

---

### **7\. Enable Messaging**

People don’t always want to call. Sometimes, they just want to ask a quick question first.

Enable “Chat with Customers” from your GBP dashboard. Then set a warm, friendly auto-response:

"Thanks for contacting \[Clinic Name\]! We'll respond within 1 business hour. For urgent bookings, please call us directly."

> Google rewards responsiveness — fast replies can help you rank better.

---

### **8\. Collect & Respond to Reviews**

Chiropractic care is personal. Prospective patients want proof that others trust you — and that you care.

How to get more 5-star reviews:

* Ask right after a great visit
* Share your review link via text or email
* Post a QR code at checkout

When replying:

* Use the patient’s name
* Mention the service they received
* Keep it warm, grateful, and human

**Example:** "Thanks, Sarah! We’re so happy your tension headaches have improved. Looking forward to your next visit!"

> Pro Tip: Patients trust reviews with thoughtful responses more than ones with no replies at all.
