Running a chiropractic clinic is no small feat. Between patient care, last-minute cancellations, managing staff, chasing down missed calls, and trying to grow your business — it’s a nonstop balancing act. And let’s face it: most days feel like you’re putting out fires instead of building a streamlined, profitable operation.

But what if your clinic ran on a system that actually worked for you — automating the busywork, organizing your leads, and making sure no opportunity slips through the cracks? That’s exactly what GoHighLevel (GHL) helps you do.

  
This playbook is your step-by-step guide to getting your foundation in place — from CRM setup and appointment scheduling to your Google Business profile and essential integrations.

### **What You Need on Day 1**

  
#### **1\. Set Up Your CRM & Patient Pipeline**

Think of your CRM as your digital filing cabinet — but smarter. Instead of digging through paper files or spreadsheets, everything lives in one place and updates automatically.

* Upload all your existing patients and leads into GHL.
* Use smart tags like "New Lead," "Consult Scheduled," "Active Patient," or "Inactive 30 Days" to keep your database organized.
* Set up a clear patient pipeline: New Lead → Consult Booked → Active Care Plan → No-Show/Follow-Up → Reactivated.

> **Pro Tip: You can manually add contacts, import a spreadsheet, or let GHL do the heavy lifting through your intake forms and lead capture funnels.**

---

#### **2\. Activate Your Online Booking Calendar**

Today’s patients don’t want to call. They want to book online in seconds.

* Set up a calendar inside GHL so patients can schedule appointments directly.
* Add buffer times, smart availability, auto-confirmation emails, and reminders.
* Link this calendar on your website, Google profile, and social media.

> **Use multiple calendars if you offer different types of appointments — New Patient Consults, Adjustments, Follow-ups, etc.**

---

#### **3\. Launch Basic Patient Automations**

Even with the best intentions, follow-ups fall through the cracks when things get busy. Automations ensure no one gets forgotten.

Start with these three workflows:

* SMS and email confirmation when a patient books
* A friendly reminder 24 hours before their appointment
* A thank-you message with a review request after their visit

> **Practices that use reminders reduce no-shows by over 30%.**

#### **4\. Set Up and Optimize Your Google Business Profile**

Your Google Business Profile is your clinic’s digital storefront. It’s how most new patients find you — often before they even click your website.

* Make sure your address, phone number, clinic hours, and website are accurate.
* Add photos of your space, staff, and happy patients.
* Include your GHL booking link right in the profile.
* Turn on messaging so patients can text you straight from search results.

> **92% of patients trust online reviews as much as word-of-mouth. A complete and active Google profile helps you rank higher and convert more searchers into bookings.** 

---

#### **5\. Turn On Missed Call Text Back**

When a patient or lead calls and no one answers — you risk losing them forever. This single feature fixes that.

* Enable a missed-call text back so every time you miss a call, GHL automatically sends a message like:  
"Hey! Sorry we missed your call. This is \[Your Clinic Name\]. How can we help?"
* You can customize this for new leads, existing patients, or even route messages to your AI receptionist.

---

#### **6\. Finalize Your Location Settings in GHL**

Your setup isn’t complete without tightening your back-end settings. These may seem small, but they power your system behind the scenes.

* Set up your business name, contact details, time zone, and clinic logo under **Business Profile**
* Connect your **Google My Business**, **Facebook**, and **Instagram** accounts so all leads and conversations live in one place
* Choose or customize your **pipeline stages** to reflect your clinic’s flow
* Configure default calendars, notifications, and lead sources
* Set your user permissions if you have team members managing bookings or follow-ups

> This setup is the “plumbing” that allows everything else to flow smoothly. Skipping it will create chaos later.

### **Outcome: Less Admin, More Booked Appointments**

  
Once you’ve set this up, here’s what changes in your day-to-day:

* Your front desk isn’t glued to the phone — patients are booking themselves.
* You stop worrying about missed follow-ups or forgotten leads.
* Every contact lives in one system — not in 3 different tools or sticky notes.
* You start getting more reviews, more referrals, and more walk-ins from Google.

In short? You’re not just hoping things work — you’ve got a system that makes them work.
