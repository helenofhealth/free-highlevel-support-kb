Most chiropractors underutilize money on ads. Not because ads don’t work — but because the targeting is off, the offer is weak, or the landing page is just their homepage. When ads are done right, they don’t feel like ads. They feel like help. And they lead people straight to your booking calendar.

This playbook is designed to help chiropractors launch simple, profitable ad campaigns that run on autopilot — and actually fill your schedule with real patients, not just clicks.

### **What Makes a High-Performing Chiropractic Ad**

Ads don’t work unless three pieces are aligned:

1. **Audience** — Are you reaching people who are actually in pain, local, and actively seeking care?
2. **Offer** — Are you giving them a reason to act now, not later?
3. **Destination** — Are you sending them to a focused landing page with one clear goal?

Miss even one of these and your ad budget can disappear without results. When aligned, however, even small budgets can deliver big results.

---

### **Before You Launch: Define Your Objective**

Every ad must serve one clear purpose:

* Generate new patient bookings?
* Grow your email/SMS list?
* Build brand awareness?
* Drive leads to a quiz or free offer?

Clarifying this upfront ensures your ad creative, targeting, and landing page are all working toward the same outcome.

### **Recommended Campaign Types for Chiropractors**

| Campaign          | Goal                                           | Budget Starter |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | -------------- |
| New Patient Offer | Attract first-timers with a limited-time deal  | $15–$30/day    |
| Local Awareness   | Build brand visibility within 5–10 mile radius | $5–$10/day     |
| Quiz Funnel       | Qualify leads through education-based content  | $20/day        |
| Retargeting       | Re-engage visitors who didn’t convert          | $5–$15/day     |

Each campaign serves a different purpose — don’t run them all at once. Start with one, validate the results, then stack them.

---

### **Visual Elements That Drive Clicks**

The ad image or video must capture attention in the first 1–2 seconds:

* **Images of the treatment room** or chiropractor in action
* **Before/after posture photos** (with consent)
* **Clear headlines overlaid on solid backgrounds**
* **Short videos** showing stretches, adjustments, or patient testimonials

Keep visuals clean, relevant, and optimized for mobile. Avoid clutter or heavy text overlays.

---

### **Targeting Tips for Local Chiropractor Ads**

**Location Targeting**

* Target a 5–10 mile radius around your clinic
* Use zip codes or map pins if in dense metro areas

**Demographic Targeting**

* Age range: 25–65
* Include parents, desk job workers, athletes, wellness seekers
* If running ads for pregnancy or pediatric care, use age/life stage filters accordingly

**Interest-Based Targeting**

* Include people interested in back pain, fitness recovery, massage therapy, posture correction

**Custom and Lookalike Audiences**

* Upload your past patient list to Facebook or Google
* Create a lookalike audience to find more people like them

### **Where to Send Your Ad Traffic**

Avoid sending people to your homepage. It has too many distractions. Instead, create and link to:

* **Lead Gen Funnel**: Offer + testimonials + short form + booking calendar
* **Quiz Funnel**: 2-3 questions leading to custom recommendations and next steps
* **Booking Page**: Clear offer with date/time selection

These pages should be mobile-friendly, fast-loading, and conversion-optimized.

---

### **How to Follow Up Automatically Using GHL**

Every new lead from your ad should trigger an automated sequence:

1. **Instant SMS** — Confirm their interest and offer a direct calendar link
2. **Email** — Deliver more context, testimonials, clinic photos, or next steps
3. **AI Chatbot (Optional)** — Ask basic scheduling questions or confirm availability

If no response:

* Follow up in 24 hours with a gentle reminder
* After 3 days, escalate with limited-time urgency
* Tag unresponsive leads for reactivation later

### **Metrics That Matter (and What They Mean)**

| Metric                    | Target       | Why It Matters                                    |
| ------------------------- | ------------ | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Click-Through Rate (CTR)  | 1%+          | Shows if your ad is resonating visually/textually |
| Cost Per Lead (CPL)       | <$15         | Tells you how efficient your budget is            |
| Booking Rate              | 20–40%       | Measures funnel strength + follow-up              |
| Return on Ad Spend (ROAS) | 3x or higher | Evaluates campaign profitability                  |

### **Scaling Your Ad Strategy Over Time**

Once your first ad is profitable, here’s how to grow:

* Duplicate and test new creative (image/video)
* Create variations of your top offer
* Expand your radius slightly or test a new segment
* Add a retargeting campaign for 7-day non-bookers
* Use testimonials in carousel or video format for trust-building

---

Running ads as a chiropractor isn’t about flashy marketing — it’s about creating a consistent pipeline of people who are already looking for help. Ads simply give them a reason to choose you now.

Keep it simple:

* One offer
* One funnel
* One follow-up path

Once that’s working, stack your campaigns, scale your spend, and let the system run.
