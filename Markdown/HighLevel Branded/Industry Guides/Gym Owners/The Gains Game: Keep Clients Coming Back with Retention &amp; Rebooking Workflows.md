## **Spot the Drop-Offs Before They Cancel**

  
ou don’t need to wait for someone to cancel their membership to know they’re slipping. HighLevel helps you **spot the ghosting before it becomes a dropout**.

* **Auto-tag your regulars who’ve gone quiet**—no check-ins for 7, 14, or 30 days? They’re flagged.
* **Fire off a casual check-in text** that sounds like it’s straight from your front desk or favorite trainer:  
_“Hey \[Name\], haven’t seen you hit the floor lately. You good? Want us to save you a spot in this week’s bootcamp?”_

Because sometimes all it takes is a quick nudge to get them back on the mat, barbell, or treadmill.

## **Celebrate the Small Wins Like a Coach Would**

  
The secret to keeping members loyal? **Make them feel seen every time they show up and level up.** HighLevel makes this easy:

* ? **Auto-send milestone messages** for:  
   * 10th class completed: _“10 sessions down! You’re on fire ?”_  
   * 1-month gym anniversary: _“One month stronger—let’s gooo!”_  
   * New personal record: _“You just crushed your last squat max—legend.”_
* ? **Add real rewards**:  
_“10 classes in? Grab a free smoothie from the fuel bar today.”_
* ? **Drop a quick check-in survey**:  
_“How’s training feeling lately? Anything you want more of?”_

With HighLevel, you can show up for your members even when you’re not physically on the floor. Because retention isn't about reminders—it's about relationships.

## **Make Rebooking a No-Brainer**

  
Most cancellations don’t happen because clients hate your gym—they just forget to book. Or life gets busy. So let’s make it stupid-easy to come back.

* ? **Automated follow-ups** before their current plan ends
* ? **1-click rebooking via SMS or WhatsApp**
* ? Texts that feel personal:  
_“Loved having you in the 6PM crew last month. Want to lock in your spot for the next 4 weeks?”_

When rebooking feels like reordering a smoothie, they’ll never ghost you again.

---

## **Layer In Loyalty and Referral Automations**

  
People talk about what they love. So give them a reason to shout your name from the rooftops (or the locker room).

* ? **Trigger a VIP tag** after 3 months of regular check-ins  
_“You’ve been crushing it—VIP status unlocked. Here’s 20% off your next class pack!”_
* ? **Referral automations that just work**:  
_“Bring a friend, get a free week—auto-applied when they sign up.”_

You’re building more than clients—you’re building a community.

## **Make Feedback Your Secret Weapon**

  
Sometimes a client dips out because of one bad playlist or a class that didn’t hit right. Don’t lose them over something you could’ve fixed in five minutes.

* ? **Auto-trigger exit workflows** when someone cancels:  
_“Hey \[Name\], we’re bummed to see you go. Quick 1-minute feedback?”_
* ? **Re-engagement offers they can’t ignore**:  
_“Miss the squat rack? Here’s 50% off next month—let’s get you back on track.”_
* ? Use real feedback to fine-tune:  
   * Class types  
   * Trainer vibes  
   * Schedule gaps

When members feel heard, they stay. When they stay, they refer. When they refer, you grow.
