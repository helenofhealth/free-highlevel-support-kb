## **1\. Get Found on Google & Dominate Local Search**

  
**Why This Matters:** When someone types "gyms near me" into Google, they’re ready to take action. But if your gym isn’t showing up—or worse, your listing looks outdated—you’re losing members before they even meet you. A polished, optimized Google presence makes you look trustworthy, active, and easy to contact.

**What You Need to Do:**

* **Claim & Verify Your Google Business Profile:** This gets your gym listed on Google Maps and search results.
* **Set Up Service Areas:** Let Google know which neighborhoods or regions you serve.
* **Add a Call Tracking Number:** So you know exactly where your calls are coming from.
* **Automate Google Review Requests:** Trigger review requests after new members sign up or complete a trial.
* **Post Weekly Updates**: Keep your Google listing fresh with photos, promos, or class announcements.

## **2\. Automate Follow-Ups & Capture Every Lead**

  
**Why This Matters:** Your prospects are browsing your website, DMing you on Instagram, and calling after hours. But without fast, consistent follow-up, those leads go cold. Automation makes sure every single inquiry gets a response—whether you're training clients or sleeping.

**What You Need to Do:**

* **Install a Chat Widget:** Greet visitors on your site and collect contact info instantly. Follow our [chat widget setup instructions](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/155000004102-getting-started-with-chat-widget).
* **Enable Missed Call Text-Back:** Follow up when someone calls but you can’t answer. [Set up missed call text-back](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/48001239140-where-and-how-to-configure-the-missed-call-text-back-feature).
* **Add a Booking Calendar:** Let leads book free trials, consults, or classes without the back-and-forth. [Learn how to set up online booking](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/155000003450-recurring-appointments).
* **Build Follow-Up Workflows:** Send automated messages that build trust over time.
* **Use ConversationAI or VoiceAI:** Let AI handle FAQs, scheduling, and lead qualification 24/7.

## **3\. Automate Reviews & Build a 5-Star Reputation**

  
**Why This Matters:** Before someone joins your gym, they’re looking you up online. Your Google rating, number of reviews, and what people say about you are often the deciding factor. Automating your review process helps ensure every happy member shares their story.

**What You Need to Do:**

* Set Up Automated Review Requests: Ask for reviews after trials, milestone achievements, or renewals.
* Use Email & SMS Templates: Save time and keep your messaging on-brand.
* Showcase Reviews Publicly: Add social proof to your site, landing pages, and ads.
* Reply to Every Review: Show appreciation and professionalism.

## **4\. Launch a Simple, High-Converting Ad Campaign**

  
**Why This Matters:** You don’t need a massive marketing budget to bring in new members. A small, smart ad campaign can put your gym in front of people who are actively looking to join—or ready to make a change.

**What You Need to Do:**

* Create Facebook Ads in HighLevel: Promote challenges, discounts, or free trials with built-in tools. [How to run Facebook ads via HighLevel](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/155000002435-create-new-ad-campaign-in-ad-manager).
* Track Leads by Ad Source: So you can see what’s working and double down.

## **5\. Stay Top of Mind with Social Media**

  
**Why This Matters:** Your Instagram or Facebook feed is the first place most people will check before they message you. If it looks outdated or inactive, they’ll move on. But if it shows energy, community, and transformation—it builds trust instantly.  
  
**What You Need to Do:**

* Turn Reviews into Posts: Show real stories from real members. [Guide to sharing reviews on social media](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/155000001620-share-your-reviews-as-posts-on-social-media-using-social-planner).
