Before potential clients even visit your website, they’re searching for services like “Botox near me” or “HydraFacial clinic in \[city\].” Your Google Business Profile is the digital storefront that helps you appear in local search and Google Maps. It’s also where clients can leave reviews, book appointments, and message your spa.

## **Step 1: Claim or Create Your Google Business Profile**

If your spa already exists on Google Maps, claim the listing. If not, create one from scratch.

1. Go to <https://business.google.com> and sign in using your business email.
2. Search for your business name. If it’s listed, claim it. If not, click **“Add your business to Google.”**
3. Set your business name and choose your category (e.g., **Medical Spa**, **Skin Care Clinic**, or **Spa**).
4. Enter your physical business address — this is required to appear on Google Maps.
5. Add a phone number and website URL. If you don’t have a website yet, use your booking link from GoHighLevel.

## **Step 2: Verify Your Listing**

Google will ask you to verify your listing. You may receive a:

* Postcard to your spa’s physical address
* Phone call
* Email (in some cases)

Once verified, you’ll gain access to the Google Business dashboard to make edits and add content.

To drive bookings directly from Google, add your GoHighLevel calendar link to the profile.

1. From your Google Business dashboard, click **Edit Profile > Booking**.
2. Paste your GoHighLevel booking calendar link (can be service-specific or general).
3. This will show as a “Book Online” button on your listing.

## **Step 5: Add Photos, Services, and Your Business Description** 

A fully built profile builds trust and drives conversions. Make sure to:

* Upload high-quality photos of your clinic, equipment, treatment rooms, and results.
* Add each of your core services (e.g., Botox, Fillers, Laser Hair Removal, PRP).
* Use location and treatment keywords in your business description (e.g., “Luxury medical spa in Austin offering advanced anti-aging and skincare treatments”).

## **Step 6: Use GoHighLevel to Automate Review Collection**

Positive reviews are one of the biggest drivers of new bookings. HighLevel can help you collect them consistently.

1. Create a **Post-Appointment Review Request Workflow** in HighLevel.
2. Include:  
   * A delay of 1–2 hours after the appointment  
   * A follow-up SMS with a personalized message and direct link to your review page
