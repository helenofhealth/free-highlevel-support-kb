Your treatments might be flawless, but what happens at the front desk sets the tone for your entire client experience.

No-shows. Missed calls. Last-minute reschedules. Sticky notes with client requests that get lost under the receptionist’s latte.

That’s where automation steps in—not to replace the warmth, but to make it _consistent._

In this guide, you’ll learn how to:

* Streamline booking and rescheduling without phone tag
* Automate reminders, confirmations, and missed call responses
* Handle reviews, payments, and follow-ups without the chaos
* Use GoHighLevel to run your spa like clockwork, even on your busiest days

## What to Automate — and How to Set It Up in GHL

### 1\. **Bookings & Reschedules**

Let clients self-book appointments via GoHighLevel’s calendar tool.

* Add booking links to your website, IG bio, and Google Business Profile
* Allow rescheduling via text or email reminders

Set up online booking calendars

---

### 2\. **Reminders & Confirmations**

Use GHL to:

* Send SMS & email reminders 48, 24, and 2 hours before appointments
* Confirm bookings instantly when a client schedules online
* Reduce no-show rate with “Confirm Now” links

---

### 3\. **Missed Call Text-Back + After-Hours Replies**

If no one answers the phone:

* Trigger an auto-text: “Sorry we missed you! Need help booking or have a question?”
* Include booking link or a prompt to leave a voicemail
