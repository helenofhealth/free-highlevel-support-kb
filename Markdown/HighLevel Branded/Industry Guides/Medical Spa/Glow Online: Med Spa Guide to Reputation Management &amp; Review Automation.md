Before a client walks through your doors, they’ve already checked your reviews. Maybe they searched “best med spa near me,” looked at your star rating, read a few glowing testimonials—or saw one negative comment you forgot to respond to. That impression? It sticks.

Your reputation is your digital aura. It speaks before you do. And in a beauty-forward, trust-driven industry like medical aesthetics, it’s often the deciding factor in whether someone books with you or your competitor.

This guide shows you how to:

* Collect 5-star reviews consistently (without begging)
* Automate post-treatment review requests
* Showcase real client love across your site and socials
* Flag and manage negative feedback proactively
* Use GoHighLevel to make the whole thing hands-free

Let’s build a glowing, high-converting reputation that reflects the luxe experience you deliver.

## **Step-by-Step: Automating Review Requests in GoHighLevel**

### **Step 1: Build a Post-Treatment Review Workflow**

Right after a treatment is when your client feels their best. That’s when you ask for feedback.

Use GoHighLevel’s workflows to:

* Set a **1–2 hour delay** post-appointment
* Send a **text + email** asking for a quick review
* Include a direct link to your Google or Yelp review page
* Optional: Add a reminder message 24 hours later if they haven’t responded

### **Step 2: Personalize Your Messages**

Example SMS:

> “Hi \[First Name\], thank you for choosing \[Your Spa Name\] today! If you loved your visit, would you mind leaving us a quick review? It helps so much. ? \[Review Link\]”

Make it:

* Warm, but not overdone
* Easy to click
* From a recognizable sender name

### **Step 3: Use Tags to Trigger Requests Based on Service**

Want to send different messages to Botox clients vs. facial clients? Use tags.

* Add a tag at checkout (e.g., “Botox Client”)
* Create review workflows by tag category
* Customize messages to mention specific treatments

This adds a layer of personalization that feels elevated and thoughtful.

## **Managing Negative Reviews Gracefully**

Even the best med spas get the occasional off day—or unfair review. The key is how you respond.

Tips:

* **Respond publicly** within 24–48 hours
* Stay professional, empathetic, and solutions-oriented
* Invite the reviewer to connect offline to resolve the issue

Example reply:

> “Hi \[Name\], we’re so sorry your visit didn’t meet expectations. We’d love the opportunity to make it right—please contact us directly at \[email\] so we can connect. Your feedback matters to us.”
