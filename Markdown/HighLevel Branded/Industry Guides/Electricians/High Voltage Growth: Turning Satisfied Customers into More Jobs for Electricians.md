## **Step 1: Automate Follow-Ups & Rebooking**

  
Many electricians lose potential repeat business by not following up after a job is completed. Without timely reminders, even very satisfied customers might forget about your services—and choose a competitor when the next need arises.

  
**Fun Fact:** 65% of customers forget who they hired after six months. Automated follow-ups ensure you’re always top-of-mind when they need you again.
  
  
### **1.1 Post-Service Follow-Up Messages**

  
Remind customers to schedule future services and offer a special discount for rebooking.

  
* Send an **automated thank-you SMS or email** after every job.
* Ask if everything is working well & remind them about future maintenance.
* Include a **special offer for their next service** to encourage rebooking.

  
> _**Example Message:**_
> 
>  
> _"Hey Mike, thanks for trusting \[Your Business Name\] for your electrical work! Everything running smoothly? Book a panel checkup in 6 months & get $50 off!_

## **Step 2: Get More 5-Star Reviews Automatically**

  
Positive reviews not only build trust but also boost your online rankings—leading to more calls and jobs. Studies show that businesses with 50+ reviews convert 270% more leads than those with fewer reviews.

After every job, trigger automated SMS and email guiding customers to leave a review on platforms like Google, Facebook, or Yelp.

### **2.2 Handle Negative Reviews Proactively**

  
Reach out immediately to dissatisfied customers to resolve issues and turn their experience around.

  
* **AI filters & flags** negative reviews before they go public.
* Customers with issues get an **instant response & a follow-up call** instead.
* **Turn unhappy customers into loyal clients** by resolving problems quickly.

## **Step 3: Create a Referral Machine**

  
Referral customers typically convert 5 times faster and spend 16% more than cold leads. Your happiest customers can be your most effective marketers when empowered with a structured referral system.
  
  
### **3.1 Set Up a Referral Program**

  
Develop an automated referral program that rewards both the referrer and the new customer, offering incentives such as discounts or service credits!

  
* Reward customers who **refer friends & family** with discounts or service credits.
* Offer an incentive to both the referrer & the new customer (e.g., **$50 off their next job**).

  
> _**Example Message:**_
> 
>  
> "Love working with us? Refer a friend & you BOTH get $50 off your next job! Just send them this link: \[Referral Link\]"

### **3.2 Automate Referral Follow-Ups**

  
Following each successful job, send a follow-up message encouraging referrals. HighLevel tracks these referrals and automatically applies the rewards, making it a seamless process.

  
> _**Example Message:**_
> 
>  
> "Mike, do you know someone who needs an electrician? Send them our way & we’ll give you BOTH $50 off!"

## **Step 4: Lock in Recurring Revenue with Maintenance Plans**

  
Offering subscription-based maintenance plans can generate up to 30% more repeat business, ensuring steady revenue and improved customer loyalty.
  
  
### **4.1 Offer Service Plans for Recurring Work**

  
Create monthly or annual service plans covering essential offerings and automate invoicing and renewal reminders for your customers!

  
* Create **monthly or annual plans** for safety inspections, surge protection checks, and breaker panel maintenance.
* Automate invoicing & renewal reminders so customers stay enrolled.

  
> _**Example Message:**_
> 
>  
> "Join our VIP Maintenance Plan: One annual inspection + priority service = $99/year. Save $ & keep your home safe!"
