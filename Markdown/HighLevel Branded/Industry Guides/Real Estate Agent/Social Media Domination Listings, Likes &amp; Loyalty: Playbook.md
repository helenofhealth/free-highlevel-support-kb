### Industry Metrics:

* 77% of real estate prospects research agents online before contacting

## Step 1: Build a Powerful Local Presence

### Why It Matters

Your next client is already online. If they can't find you—or trust you—another agent wins the listing.

---

### 1.1 Choose the Right Platforms for Real Estate

  
| Platform     | Best Use Case                                |
| ------------ | -------------------------------------------- |
| Facebook     | Local visibility, reviews, open house events |
| Instagram    | Listings photos, stories, reels              |
| LinkedIn     | B2B referrals, investor networking           |
| YouTube      | Neighborhood tours, market updates           |
| GBP (Google) | Reviews + contact hub + SEO for agents       |

  
**Use Case:**  
An agent in Denver posted weekly “Neighborhood Feature Friday” reels on IG & FB—within 60 days, they doubled inbound buyer leads from social.

---

## Step 2: Post Content That Sells You Without Selling

### Why It Matters

No one wants “Just Sold” spam all day. But smart, helpful, and human content builds your reputation and drives DM inquiries.

---

### 2.1 What to Post

  
| Content Type        | Example Post                                                            |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Property Spotlights | “Take a peek inside this renovated 3-bed in East Austin”                |
| Buyer Education     | “Top 3 things NOT to do before closing on your mortgage”                |
| Seller Advice       | “Why staging your home can increase sale price by up to 20%”            |
| Behind the Scenes   | “We just negotiated $15K off asking for our client ?”                   |
| Testimonials        | “Here’s what Julie said after selling with us…”                         |
| Local Features      | “Why people love living in \[Your Area\] — Top 5 walkable coffee spots” |

### 2.2 Hashtag & Keyword Strategy

* **Instagram/Facebook**: #FirstTimeBuyer #JustListed #HomeGoals
* **LinkedIn**: #RealEstateMarketing #HomeSellingTips
* **Google Posts**: “\[City\] Realtor”, “Top Agent in \[Neighborhood\]”

**Tip:** Always tag your city & neighborhoods in captions for local SEO.

## Step 3: Use Smart Ads to Fill Your Pipeline

### Why It Matters

Only 5–10% of your followers see organic posts. Ads put your listings and value in front of the right people—fast.

---

### 3.1 High-Impact Ad Campaign Ideas

* Facebook Lead Ads: “Want to know what your home is worth in this market? Get your free report.”
* Instagram Reels Ads: Property walk-through with CTA to “Book a Tour”
* Retargeting Ads: Re-engage site visitors with a new listing or offer
* Google LSAs: For “top agents near me” and “sell my home \[city\]”

**Use Case:**  
An agent in Sacramento spent $250 on FB ads promoting a “Get Your Free CMA” funnel—generated 9 seller leads and booked 4 listing consults in 10 days.

---

### 3.2 Targeting That Converts

* ZIP code + 10–15 mile radius
* Age: 30–65+
* Interests: Real estate, home improvement, moving soon, mortgage
* Custom audiences: Website visitors, past leads, Instagram engagers

---

### 3.3 Budget Recommendations

  
| Business Stage     | Suggested Ad Spend       |
| ------------------ | ------------------------ |
| Solo Agent         | $10/day ($300/month)     |
| Small Team         | $25/day ($750/month)     |
| Multi-Agent Office | $50+/day ($1,500+/month) |
