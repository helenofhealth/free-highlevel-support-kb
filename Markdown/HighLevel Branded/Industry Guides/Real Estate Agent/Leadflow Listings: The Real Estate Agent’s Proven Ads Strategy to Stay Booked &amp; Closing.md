### Why This Playbook Matters

Most agents rely on referrals, open houses, or yard signs. But in today’s digital-first housing market, if you’re not visible online — you’re invisible.

**Industry Metrics:**

* 97% of home buyers use the internet to search for properties
* 70% of real estate leads go with the first agent who responds
* Paid ads generate 200–400% ROI when combined with instant follow-ups

If your competitor is running ads and you're not — you're already behind.

## Step 1: Get Found with Google Ads & Local Services Ads (LSA)

### Why It Matters

When someone decides to buy or sell, they Google “Realtor near me.”  
And 3 out of 4 people go with the first agent who responds.

---

### 1.1 Set Up Google Local Services Ads

Appear at the top of search results with keywords like:

* “Top realtor in \[City\]”
* “Sell my house fast”
* “Buy a home near \[Zip Code\]”
* LSAs are pay-per-lead (not click)
* Google Guaranteed badge increases conversion rates by up to 30%

**Use Case:**  
An agent in Phoenix using “sell my house fast” LSA ads booked 22% of leads into appointments with automation.

### 1.2 Run High-Intent Google PPC Ads

Target keywords like:

* “Realtors near me”
* “Homes for sale \[City\]”
* “Free home value report”

Pair ads with a HighLevel landing page CTA like “Find Out What Your Home Is Worth Today”

Start with $25–$50/day focused on high-intent keywords.
