## Step 3: Automate Reviews & Build Referral Power

### Why It Matters

90% of buyers and sellers read online reviews before choosing an agent.  
Reputation = authority.

✅ Direct clients to leave reviews on Google, Zillow, and Facebook  
✅ Get notified of any low ratings to fix before they go public  
✅ Post 5-star reviews across social profiles and websites

  
**Example Review Request:**  
"Congrats on the new home, Sarah! If you enjoyed working together, would you mind sharing a quick review? It helps a ton! \[Link\]"**[](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/155000001074-maximizing-customer-engagement-with-reviews-ai-a-guide-to-suggestive-and-auto-pilot-modes)**

## Step 4: Launch Ads That Drive Real Conversations

## Step 5: Stay Consistent on Social (Without Doing It Manually)

### Why It Matters

Agents who post consistently stay top of mind and get 30% more repeat business.  
But you can’t grow if you’re stuck writing posts all day.[](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/155000001620-share-your-reviews-as-posts-on-social-media-using-social-planner)
