## Step 1: Understand Real Estate-Specific Content Types

### Why It Matters

Throwing up a “Just Sold” post doesn’t make the phone ring.  
Strategic content = leads, loyalty, and listings.

---

### 1.1 Four Proven Content Types for Agents

  
| Content Type                | Purpose                           | Example Ideas                                                   |
| --------------------------- | --------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Educational & Tips          | Showcase authority, build trust   | “Top 3 Mistakes First-Time Buyers Make”                         |
| Market & Listing Driven     | Capture interest, drive inquiries | “New 3-Bed Listing in Plano—Walkthrough Video Inside!”          |
| Testimonials & Social Proof | Build credibility & referrals     | “See how we helped the Smiths sell for $42K above asking”       |
| Community & Engagement      | Boost reach & visibility          | “Which local neighborhood has the best walk score? Let’s vote!” |

  
✅ Agent’s 80/20 Rule:  
80% value + trust-building  
20% direct offers or calls to action

---

## Step 2: Platform Strategy for Real Estate Professionals

### Why It Matters

Each platform has a different audience. Tailoring content = better results.

---

| Platform          | What to Post                                | Frequency    |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ------------ |
| Google Business   | Client reviews, just listed/sold homes      | 1–3x weekly  |
| Facebook          | Market updates, listing carousels           | 3–5x weekly  |
| Instagram         | Reels, behind-the-scenes tours, story polls | 3–5x weekly  |
| YouTube           | Neighborhood guides, walk-throughs          | 1–2x weekly  |
| LinkedIn          | Investment advice, relocation content       | 2x weekly    |
| Website Blog      | Local market trends, buyer/seller guides    | 2–4x monthly |
| TikTok (optional) | Short tips, “day in the life” clips         | 3–5x weekly  |

  
✅ Pro Tip: Posting consistently on GBP improves your map ranking and gets you 30–40% more local profile visits.

## Step 3: Content That Converts Leads to Closings

### Why It Matters

No fluff. Just hooks, value, and next steps.

---

### 3.1 Content Framework:

**HOOK → VALUE → CTA**

**Example Post:**

* Hook: “Thinking of selling this spring? Don’t do it without this tip…”
* Value: “Homes listed with pre-inspections sell 2x faster and avoid renegotiations.”
* CTA: “Want my pre-listing checklist? DM me ‘SELL SMART’ and I’ll send it!”

---

### 3.2 Real-World Content Examples

| Content Type   | Headline Example                           | CTA                                       |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------- |
| Educational    | “5 Things That Scare Away Home Buyers”     | “Want a free seller checklist?”           |
| Urgency Driven | “New Listing: Won’t Last the Weekend!”     | “Book your private showing now”           |
| Social Proof   | “Sold in 4 Days, $15K Over Ask—Here's How” | “Let’s talk about your home's value”      |
| Engagement     | “Would You Live Next to a Golf Course?”    | “Vote & tag a friend who’s house hunting” |

---

## Step 4: Measure What Works Using Metrics That Matter

### Why It Matters

Leads don’t come from likes—they come from clicks, replies, and conversations.

---

| Metric                      | Insight                                      |
| --------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Lead Conversion from Social | Which content brings DMs, calls, inquiries   |
| Booking Rate from Website   | Which links convert to appointments          |
| Avg. Response Time          | Response within 5 mins = 9x more conversions |
| Review Count & Quality      | Improves both SEO & trust                    |
| Repeat/Referral Rate        | Shows lifetime value from happy clients      |

  
✅ Pro Tip: Agents who respond to social leads within 10 minutes see 300% more replies.

---
