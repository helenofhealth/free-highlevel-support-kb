## **Step 1: Get Found with Google Ads & Local Services Ads**

## **Why It Matters?**

#### When homeowners need HVAC repairs, **they Google it first.**

* #### **70% of HVAC customers hire a provider who appears in the first five search results.**
* #### **Google Local Services Ads (LSA) deliver leads, not clicks**, making them the most cost-effective way to advertise.
* #### **The average cost per lead (CPL) for HVAC businesses on Google Ads is $30 - $100**, but can be lower with proper targeting.

  
### **1.1 Set Up Google Local Services Ads (LSA)**

#### ✅ Appear at the top of search results for **“HVAC repair near me”** or **“AC installation services.”**  
✅ Pay **only for valid leads**—not just clicks.  
✅ Get **Google Guaranteed certification** (increases lead conversion rates by **30%**).  
✅ Target high-intent service categories:

* #### **AC Repair** (Spring & Summer)
* #### **Heating Repair & Furnace Services** (Fall & Winter)
* #### **HVAC Tune-Ups & Maintenance Plans** (Year-round)

#### **Example:**  
An HVAC company running LSAs for **“Emergency AC Repair 24/7”** sees **higher-intent leads** and **40%+ close rates.**
