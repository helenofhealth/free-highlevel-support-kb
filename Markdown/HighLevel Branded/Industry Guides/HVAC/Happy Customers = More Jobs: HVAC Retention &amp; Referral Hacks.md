## **Step 1: Automate Follow-Ups & Rebooking**

### **Why It Matters?**

#### Most HVAC companies **lose money** because they don’t follow up.  
Fact: **65% of homeowners forget which HVAC company they hired within a year.**

#### ✅ **Problem:** You installed a new AC system, but never followed up for maintenance.  
✅ **Result:** A year later, when they need service, **they hire someone else** just because that company followed up first.  
✅ **Solution:** Automated follow-ups ensure **loyal customers and repeat service calls—without extra effort.**
  
  
### **1.1 Post-Service Follow-Up Messages**

* #### Send an **automated thank-you SMS or email** after every install or service call.
* #### Ask if their system is running well & remind them about maintenance checkups.
* #### Offer a **discount for their next seasonal tune-up** to encourage rebooking.

#### **Example Message:**  
_"Hey Mike, thanks for trusting \[Your HVAC Company\] for your AC install! Everything running smoothly? Book a seasonal checkup in 6 months & get $50 off!"_

#### ✅ Referral customers convert **5X faster.**  
✅ They **spend 16% more** than cold leads**.**  
✅ They **trust your brand** before even calling you.

  
### **3.1 Set Up a Referral Program**

* #### Offer a **discount or service credit** for every referral.
* #### Give incentives to **both the referrer & the new customer** (Example: $50 off their next service).

#### **Example Message:**  
_"Love working with us? Refer a friend & you BOTH get $50 off your next HVAC service! Just send them this link: \[Referral Link\]"_

### **5.1 Smart Lists for Re-Engagement**

* #### Create lists of past customers by:  
   * #### Service type  
   * #### Location

* #### **Send reminders, upgrade offers, and special promotions.**
