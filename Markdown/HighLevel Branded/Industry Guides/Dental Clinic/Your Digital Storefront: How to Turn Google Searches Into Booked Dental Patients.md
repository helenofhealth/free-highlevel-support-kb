When someone searches “dentist near me,” your Google Business Profile (GBP) is often the first — and sometimes only — impression you get. It’s your digital storefront. If it’s missing information, outdated, or lacking reviews, you’re losing patients before they even click.

This playbook walks you through how to fully optimize your dental clinic’s profile — and how to automate the workflows that keep it fresh, trusted, and driving bookings.

### **Step 1: Claim and Complete Your Google Business Profile**

  
* Go to [Google Business Profile Manager](https://business.google.com/)
* Use your official clinic email (ideally matching your domain)
* Search for your clinic name  
   * If found: Claim it  
   * If not: Create it using accurate NAP info (Name, Address, Phone)

> Tip: Make sure your NAP is identical on your website, Facebook, Yelp, and insurance directories.

### **Step 2: Choose the Right Categories**

  
Primary Category:

* **Dentist**

Secondary Categories (only if applicable):

* Cosmetic Dentist
* Emergency Dental Service
* Pediatric Dentist
* Dental Implants Periodontist
* Teeth Whitening Service

Avoid adding categories that don’t match your actual offerings. Irrelevant tags can reduce your profile’s ranking.

### **Step 3: Nail the Business Info**

  
Check that your profile includes:

* Business Name (brand-consistent, no extra keywords)
* Address (Map-pinned and consistent with your site)
* Business Phone Number (no personal numbers)
* Website URL (ideally your GHL booking page or service funnel)
* Hours (accurate — especially for holidays or emergency availability)

  
**Edit your business description**

---

### **Step 4: Write a Trust-Building Clinic Description**

  
Use this structure:

* Who you serve (families, professionals, kids)
* What you specialize in (gentle care, cosmetic dentistry, same-day crowns)
* What makes you different (comfort-first experience, sedation options, insurance accepted)

**Example:** "At Riverside Family Dental, we offer complete care in a warm, welcoming environment. From gentle cleanings and Invisalign to same-day emergency care, our team serves families and working professionals in San Antonio with advanced, compassionate dentistry."

---

### **Step 5: Add High-Quality Photos**

  
According to Google, listings with photos get:

* 42% more direction requests
* 35% more click-throughs to websites

Include:

* Exterior (entrance, signage)
* Reception area
* Operatories and dental tech
* Staff group photos (smiling, professional)
* Before/after smile transformations (with consent)

Keep them bright, professional, and updated quarterly.

### **Step 6: List Your Services Clearly**

  
Break down each offer:

* Dental Cleaning & Exam – $99 New Patient Offer
* Emergency Appointment – Available Same Day
* Invisalign Consult – Free, Includes 3D Scan
* Teeth Whitening – Packages starting at $199

Use GHL to include your funnel or calendar link directly in service descriptions.

---

### **Step 7: Enable Messaging**

  
Turn on the "Chat" feature so patients can reach you directly through GBP.

* Use GHL’s unified inbox to respond in real time
* Set up an auto-reply like: “Thanks for messaging \[Clinic Name\]! We’ll get back to you shortly or you can book here: \[Link\]”

---

### **Step 8: Collect Reviews Automatically with GHL**

  
* Use GHL workflows to trigger a review request after every completed appointment
* Personalize by treatment type (e.g., “How was your Invisalign consult?”)
* Send via SMS with a direct Google review link
* Follow up 48 hours later if no review is left

> GHL also lets you monitor and respond to reviews from the same dashboard you manage messages, bookings, and contacts.

---

### **Step 9: Keep Your Profile Active with Posts**

  
Google favors active profiles. Use GHL’s Social Planner to:

* Post tips (“3 foods that stain your teeth”), promos (“Whitening sale this week”), or FAQs
* Schedule 1–2 updates per week
* Include a call-to-action like “Book Now” or “Claim Offer” with your calendar link

---

### **Final Word**

Your Google Business Profile isn’t just a listing. It’s your 24/7 marketing assistant — and a high-converting lead source. With the right optimization and the power of GHL behind it, it becomes a booking engine.

Keep it accurate. Keep it active. Let GHL automate the rest.
