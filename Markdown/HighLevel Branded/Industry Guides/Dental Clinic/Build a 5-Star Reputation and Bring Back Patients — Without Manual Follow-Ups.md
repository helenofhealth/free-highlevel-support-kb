Your dental clinic’s online reputation is no longer a bonus—it’s the foundation of how new patients find you, trust you, and decide to book with you. A strong reputation not only attracts new patients but also reinforces trust with existing ones. And if you're not consistently following up with patients who haven’t returned, you're likely leaving thousands in revenue on the table.

This playbook shows you exactly how to automate your reputation management and reactivation workflows using GoHighLevel—without adding to your staff’s plate. Whether you're running a single-location practice or scaling a group, these strategies help you build long-term loyalty, fill gaps in your schedule, and become the highest-rated clinic in your area.

### **Part 1: Online Reviews — Your Most Powerful Dental Marketing Tool**

  
When patients search for “dentist near me,” they rarely click the first result—they click the one with the **highest rating and most recent 5-star reviews**. Google knows this. So do your competitors. A great reputation isn’t built by chance—it’s built by design.

#### Why Reviews Matter More Than Ever:

* **88% of patients** trust online reviews as much as a personal recommendation
* **72%** won’t consider a clinic with less than 4 stars
* Reviews directly impact your **Google Maps ranking** and local SEO
* Reviews double as **social proof**, building instant credibility

Even if you run paid ads or have a beautiful website, a poor reputation—or too few reviews—can kill conversions.

### **Step-by-Step: Automate Your Review Collection**

####   

#### **Step 1: Set the Trigger**

Use GHL to trigger an automated review request after every completed appointment.

* Use pipeline status (e.g., "Appointment Completed") as your automation trigger
* Build a short delay of 1–2 hours after the visit (to avoid seeming too robotic)
* Send both SMS and email with personalization tokens (name, service)

**[How to Setup Workflow Triggers for Google and Facebook Reviews](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/155000003873-how-to-setup-workflow-triggers-for-google-and-facebook-reviews)**
  
  
#### **Step 2: Craft the Message**

  
Your message should feel like a casual thank-you, not a marketing blast.

**SMS Example:** "Hi Lisa! Thank you for visiting BrightSmile Dental today. If you enjoyed your visit, would you mind leaving a quick Google review? It helps us grow and helps others find great care. Here’s the link: "\[Link\]"

**Email Example:** Subject: We’d love your feedback Body: "Hi Lisa, we truly appreciate you choosing BrightSmile Dental. If you had a positive experience, we’d be grateful if you could leave us a short review on Google. It means a lot to our team and helps others find us when they need dental care."

#### **Step 3: Make Leaving a Review Frictionless**

  
* Create a shortened Google Review link using GHL’s built-in tools
* Add the link to your check-out confirmation emails
* Display a QR code at reception with a "Review Us" prompt
* Include review links in email signatures for hygienists or doctors

**[How to Send Review Requests](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/48001222668-how-to-send-review-requests)**

  
#### **Step 4: Train Your Staff to “Plant the Seed”**

  
Front desk and hygienists can casually mention: "Hey, if everything felt good today, we’d love a quick review. You’ll get a text link in a bit. It only takes a minute."

> This in-person touch dramatically increases review rates—even with automation running.

  
#### **Step 5: Respond to Every Review**

  
Google prioritizes businesses that actively engage with reviews. Reply to all reviews within 24–48 hours.

**For positive reviews:** "Thanks so much, David! We’re thrilled your cleaning went well. Looking forward to seeing you at your next 6-month checkup."

**For critical feedback:** "Hi Amy, thank you for sharing this. We’re sorry your visit didn’t go as expected. Please call our office—we’d love the chance to make things right."

### **Part 2: Patient Reactivation — The Easiest Growth Lever You’re Not Using**

  
It costs 5x more to acquire a new patient than to reactivate an existing one. Most dental practices are sitting on a massive list of patients who simply fell off their schedule—because of life, forgetfulness, or fear.

They don’t need a hard sell. They need a nudge.

### **How to Build a Reactivation Engine in GHL**

####   

#### **Step 1: Segment Your Inactive Patient List**

  
Use GHL’s smart lists or filters to segment by:

* Last appointment date (30, 60, 90, 180+ days)
* Last treatment (e.g., patients who haven’t completed a filling, crown, or follow-up)
* Type of care (e.g., ortho patients who didn’t return for aligner scans)

Create tags like:

* "Overdue 3 Months"
* "Ortho Follow-Up Missed"
* "Hygiene Reactivation Needed"

  
**<https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/155000003439-guide-to-pre-built-contact-segments>**

  
#### **Step 2: Write Reengagement Messages That Feel Personal**

  
Avoid sounding corporate. These should feel like one-on-one check-ins.

**Soft Reminder (30–60 Days):** "Hi Jake, just checking in from BrightSmile Dental! It’s been a couple months since we last saw you—ready to schedule your next cleaning? We’re here when you’re ready. Book here: \[Link\]"

**Friendly Re-offer (90+ Days):** "Hey Emily! We’ve set aside a few $25 credit spots this week for returning patients who’ve been away a while. Want one? Just book online by Friday: \[Link\]"

**Treatment-Based Follow-Up:** "Hi Josh, your last visit showed a cavity that we haven’t treated yet. Let’s get it taken care of before it turns into something bigger. Schedule your appointment here: \[Link\]"
  
  
#### **Step 3: Automate the Entire Journey**

  
In GHL:

* Create a Smart List with "Last Appointment > 90 Days"
* Trigger a reactivation workflow with 2–3 messages spaced out over a week
* Use conditional logic (e.g., if they click but don’t book, send a friendly nudge)
* Add internal alerts for front desk follow-up if needed
