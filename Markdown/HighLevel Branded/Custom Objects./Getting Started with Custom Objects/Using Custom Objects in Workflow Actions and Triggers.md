## **Use Case**

  
A real estate agency uses a custom object called "Home" to track home listings. When the Home Status field is marked as "Closed" (indicating the property is sold), they want to automate the next steps, including updating records and logging sales data.  
  
Trigger:  
  
* Object Changed: Trigger the workflow when the Home Status field in the "Home" object changes to "Closed".

Workflow Actions:

  
* Update Associated Object: Update an associated object (e.g., "Agent") linked to the sold property.
* Add a Row to Google Sheets: Use the Google Sheets Integration to log the sale in a centralized document for tracking and reporting.
* Clear a Field in the Object or Associated Object: Clear the temporary Notes and Internal Comment custom fields that are no longer needed.
