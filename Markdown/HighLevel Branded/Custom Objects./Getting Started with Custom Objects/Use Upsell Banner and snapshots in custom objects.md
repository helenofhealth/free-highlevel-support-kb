Whatâ€™s New?  
  
Agencies on $97 and $297 plans now have:

* An upsell banner showing upgrade options, visible only to the agency users and admins.
* Access to Custom Object Snapshots through Marketplace and Templates (Coming Soon!)

## How to Use

* Go to your agency dashboard as an admin or user.
* If you're not yet on a plan with access (i.e., 497$ plan) , you'll see an upsell banner guiding you to upgrade.

* If you're already on the 97 or 297 plan, you can now access and load Custom Object Snapshots directly from your agency view.

Note: Sub-accounts on the 97 & 297$ plan can use the loaded Custom Objects but cannot modify their structure (like display names, icons, or feed types).

They can, however, add and edit fields, records or associations inside those objects.

  
Frequently Asked Questions

Can I create or edit Custom Objects on the 97$ or 297$ plan?  
No. Custom Object creation and structural editing (e.g., field names, icons, feed types) are only available on the 497 plan. You can use the upsell banner to upgrade.

Can I use snapshots that contain Custom Objects?  
Yes. If you're on the 97 or 297 plan, you can load snapshots that include Custom Objects into sub-accounts.

How do I upgrade to gain full access?  
Click the upsell banner on your dashboard or contact support to switch to the 497$ plan and unlock full Custom Object creation and editing capabilities.
