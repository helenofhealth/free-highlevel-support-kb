## 1\. **Affiliate Created Workflow Trigger**

### **Trigger Setup**:

* Go to **Add New Workflow Trigger** \> Search for **Affiliate Created** \> Choose it.
* Click on **Save Trigger**.

### **How It Works**:

* This workflow is triggered whenever a new affiliate is created in the sub-account.

### **Example**:

* If you run a marketing campaign and several affiliates sign up, the moment each one is added, this trigger ensures they are automatically included in your workflows without manual intervention.

## 2\. **Add to Affiliate Manager**

### **Automation Setup**:

* Automatically add a contact to the Affiliates list in the Affiliate Manager with their status set to "active."

### **How It Works**:

* As soon as the workflow is triggered, a contact is added as an active affiliate in your system.

### **Example**:

* If a potential partner signs up, they’re immediately added to your list of active affiliates, ensuring no delay in their onboarding process.![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155033844788/original/43LBpDKVH8Iwr6S_lP1JjBVDN5WJKeiDcw.jpeg?1727763735)

### **Automation Setup**:

* Allows you to update the affiliate status as either "active" or "inactive."
* **Supported Options**:  
   * Mark as Active  
   * Mark as Inactive

## **5\.** **Remove from Affiliate Campaign**

### **Automation Setup**:

* This option removes an affiliate from a campaign. Choose the campaign to remove them from using a dropdown menu.
