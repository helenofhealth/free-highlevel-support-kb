1. Go to Workflows and click + Create Workflow
2. Set the Trigger as **Lead Created**
3. (**Optional**) Use the Campaign Filter to narrow it to a specific campaign![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155046919716/original/9rsHc5Z5_Sx71eszGZk8KJbQiXGFuci22Q.png?1747737828)
4. Add actions like:  
   1. Send email to affiliate  
   2. Notify internal team
5. Use custom values from the Lead Created section in emails/messages![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155046919760/original/XaZPVUfJB0b4WuoOJkd_o9uYMyuMWuZ-Fg.png?1747737844)
6. Save and publish your workflow

## **Action: Add Leads under an Affiliate**

### **What it does**

The "Add Leads under an Affiliate" action assigns a contact (lead) to an affiliate and their associated campaign, making sure affiliates are correctly credited.

  
You can now choose from three assignment methods for total flexibility.

  
### **How to Use It**

1. In your workflow, add the action: `**Add Leads under an Affiliate**`
2. Choose your assignment method:  
   * **Manual**  
   * **Auto (Attribution)**  
   * **Custom Mapping**
3. Configure additional fields based on the method
4. Save and publish the workflow

  
### **Assignment Methods**

1\. Manual : Manually assign a lead to a known affiliate in a specific campaign.  
**Best for:** Form submissions, internal routing, admin decisions.

**Steps:**

* Select campaign
* Select affiliate (from affiliates in that campaign)![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155046514809/original/CcKuxYwq4yOIQ_cx6E4yJDvAb3NnJEwUdA.png?1747119576)

2\. Auto (Attribution via URL) : Automatically assign leads using `am_id` passed in the **URL parameters**.  
Supports **first** or **last click** attribution.

**Steps:**

* Choose Attribution Method: First / Last
* Make sure `am_id` is passed earlier in the funnel (e.g., form/page URL)![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155046514824/original/COmOzfhsvwzF7jK5RHBib1SjxVAI-szQpA.png?1747119591)

3\. Custom Mapping : Use if `am_id` is stored in a **custom field** or passed as a workflow value.  
**Best for:** API pushes, third-party systems, hidden fields on forms.

**Steps:**

* Choose mapping source: custom field or workflow value
* System reads value and assigns the lead to the matching affiliate![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155046514851/original/cYBBMy6l6rRl8DKAaM8P4WCbLdraHVPOFw.png?1747119602)

  
### **Use Cases**

* Reward Lead Generation  
**Example:** A lead fills a form → system assigns them to the affiliate who shared the link → sends a “Congrats!” email.
* Custom Lead Nurturing  
**Example:** Leads from a funnel are assigned to specific affiliates for 1-on-1 follow-up — boosting conversion rates.
* Simplify Administrative Tasks  
**Example:** Replace manual lead assignments with automation — perfect for busy teams managing many affiliates.
