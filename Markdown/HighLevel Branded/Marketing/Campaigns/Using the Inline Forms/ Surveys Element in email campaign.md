**When to Use It:**

1. Collect product feedback (1-10 scale).

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

  
**Q:Do I need a custom success URL for form responses to be tracked in email campaigns?**

No. Form submissions including ratings, Like/Dislike, and scoring are tracked as soon as a contact clicks on the element inside the email.

  
A custom success URL is completely optional. It’s only used to control where the user is redirected after clicking (for example, to a thank-you page or external link).

  
Even if you don’t set a redirect, the submission will still appear in your campaign statistics under the Submissions tab. To identify each form’s response clearly, be sure to give your form a unique title during setup.
