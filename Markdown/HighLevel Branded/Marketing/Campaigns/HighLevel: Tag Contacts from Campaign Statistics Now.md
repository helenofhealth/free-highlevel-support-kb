**Overview**  
You can now tag contacts based on their interaction with a campaign (opens, clicks, etc.) directly from the campaign’s statistics page. This allows you to instantly segment and personalise your follow-ups—without setting up tags in advance. Plus, with **auto-tagging**, new contacts who engage with your campaign will be tagged automatically in real-time, keeping your segments updated effortlessly.
