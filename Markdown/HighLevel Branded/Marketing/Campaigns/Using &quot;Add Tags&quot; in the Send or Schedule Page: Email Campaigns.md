## **What is the Add Tags in the Send or Schedule Page Feature?**

  
The Create New Tags in the Send or Schedule Page feature allows users to generate new contact tags on-the-fly while scheduling or sending email campaigns in HighLevel. Tags are used to segment contacts, trigger automations, and organize campaign recipients. Previously, tags had to be created in advance from the Contacts or Tags section, but now you can add them instantly during campaign setup, making the process faster and more intuitive.

**IMPORTANT**: If you wish to add a new tag which is not created previously in the CRM, just type in the New Tag Name. For example: I wish to add a tag called as "Adit_test", which is a new tag, hence I would be simply typing in "Adit_test" to add this new tag.
