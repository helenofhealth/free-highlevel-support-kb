### **What is Workflow Campaigns?**

Workflow campaigns refer to the combination of all email actions present within a workflow. They allow you to manage and analyze email communications triggered by various workflow steps, offering a comprehensive view of the performance of each email action within a workflow.

To streamline your analysis, we’ve introduced a new way to view statistics for all your email campaigns—whether sent through workflows or as standalone campaigns.

###   
**Why is This Beneficial?**:

* **Unified Statistics**: Having workflow email stats under **Email Marketing** makes it easier to track and compare campaign performance from one place.
* **Comprehensive Insights**: You can now view both the overall workflow stats and break them down by individual email actions, allowing for deeper analysis of each step in your workflow.
* **Simplified Editing**: You can edit workflows directly from the statistics screen, speeding up the process of making changes and improving efficiency

### **How to Use**:

1. **Navigate to Workflow Campaigns**:  
   * Go to **Email Marketing** \-> **Campaigns** \-> **Workflow Campaigns**.  
   * This screen will give you access to the overall and individual email statistics.![workflow-campaign-screen](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155034932865/original/rkCijC6vkmuRco_7DwnRGEKb7KWgLaTWxg.jpeg?1729228687)
