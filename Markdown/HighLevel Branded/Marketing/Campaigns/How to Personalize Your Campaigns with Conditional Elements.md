**What is a Conditional Element?**  
A conditional element allows you to display content—such as images or text—only if a contact meets certain criteria. This enables you to tailor your messaging to individual contacts automatically.

###   
**When Can You Use Them?**

1. **Location-based content**: Display different images or offers depending on a contact’s geographic location.
2. **Field-based text**: Change a text element based on specific contact fields, like their job title or interests.

###   
**Benefits**

1. **Personalization**: Make your campaigns more relevant by showing customized content to each contact.
2. **Time-Saving**: Avoid the need to create smart lists and separate campaigns—use one campaign with conditional elements instead.
3. **Increased Engagement**: Showing content that's personalized to each recipient increases the likelihood of higher click-through rates, responses, and conversions.
4. **Simplified Campaign Management**: Instead of juggling various lists and campaigns, manage all variations of content in one place, reducing complexity and chances for error.
