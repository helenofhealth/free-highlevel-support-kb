## **Why Plain Text?**

Plain text emails offer a simple, personal approach similar to messages from your personal inbox. They focus on the message itself with minimal branding and design.

They have multiple use cases, some of them are -

* Text heavy communications use big text snippets. This editor ensures symmetric readability across all devices.
* Personalized emails like welcome emails or apology emails are still preferred to be direct and not design-heavy

## **What do the metrics say?**

Various researches have shown that the probability of a customer interacting with a plain text email is almost twice as high as that of a design-intensive email. 

## **Benefits:**

* Simplicity: Easy to understand and use.
* Personalization: Feels like a direct communication.
* Compatibility: Fewer rendering issues across email clients. This looks great on any device

## **How to Use:**
