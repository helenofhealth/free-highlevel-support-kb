**Things to know before you start adding google fonts to your email.**  
  
Using Google Fonts can help make sure that your emails look like they belong with your website or online store. But not all devices and email services will show these fonts the same way.

Here are some email services where Google Fonts might not work well:

* Gmail on the web, iPhone, Android, and the web browser version
* Outlook on Macs, iPhones, Android phones, and [Outlook.com](//Outlook.com)
* Yahoo Mail  
    
    
**How to Use It:**
* Navigate to the email builder section of our platform. Open an existing email campaign or template, or start a new one.
