## **Frequently Asked Questions**

  
**Q: What’s the difference between soft and hard bounces?**  
Soft bounces are temporary (e.g., full inbox). Hard bounces are permanent (e.g., invalid email) and can harm your sender reputation.  
  
**Q: How long do email statistics take to update?**  
Most email stats update in near real-time, but some events (like clicks, unsubscribes, or spam complaints) may take a few minutes to appear depending on recipient activity and email provider delays.

  
**Q: Do I need to use Mailgun to see full email stats?**  
Yes. Only Mailgun supports full visibility into key metrics like delivered, bounced, unsubscribed, and spam complaints. Other SMTP providers may only support basic tracking like opens and clicks.
