With the new on-the-fly tag creation feature, you can now create and apply new tags directly while scheduling or sending an email campaign—without leaving the campaign flow or navigating to the Tags section first.

# Important Notes

When you create a tag this way, it is automatically added to your overall Tags list in the CRM and becomes available for use in other campaigns and automations.

Be careful with spelling and naming consistency to avoid unintentionally creating duplicate or similarly named tags. Always double-check before finalizing.

# Frequently Asked Questions

Q: Can I edit or remove a tag after I schedule my campaign?  
 You can edit or remove tags as long as the campaign hasn’t been sent yet. Once the campaign is sent, the tags are applied and cannot be removed automatically.

Q: Will tags created on the fly appear in my CRM tags list?  
 Yes. Any tag created during scheduling will be saved and visible in your CRM’s overall Tags list for future use.

Q: Do I always need to enable Automate?  
 Only if you want the tags to trigger specific automations. You can add tags without enabling Automate if you just want to segment your audience.

Q: Can I add multiple new tags at the same time?  
 Yes. You can create and apply multiple new tags before finalizing your campaign schedule.

# Next Steps

* Review your current campaigns and identify where tags could help improve segmentation and follow-ups.
* Try creating new tags during your next email campaign schedule to streamline your process.
* Set up or update automations that use these new tags to drive more personalized communication and engagement.
