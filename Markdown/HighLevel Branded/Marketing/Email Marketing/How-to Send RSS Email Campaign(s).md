# **Introduction.**

RSS enables you as a business owner to deliver updates and newly published blog content via email. And, rather than sending an email every time a blog is published—which may annoy your user base—you can send periodic RSS emails or newsletters that provide an overview of blog content those user base may have missed out on.
