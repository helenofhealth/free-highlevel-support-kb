# What is the Arrow Control Feature?

The Arrow Control feature in the Email Builder allows users to move elements or layout sections up or down with a simple click. This improvement eliminates the hassle of precise drag-and-drop movement and streamlines the design process for email campaigns and templates.

## Key Benefits of Arrow Controls

Arrow controls provide a smoother and more user-friendly experience when designing emails.

* Speeds up layout reordering.
* Simplifies element movement without relying solely on drag-and-drop.
* Reduces design errors from misplacing blocks.
* Enhances the email-building experience for beginners.
* Allows precise layout adjustments with just one click.
* Works for both individual elements and entire layout blocks.

## How To Use Arrow Controls to Rearrange Layouts

Arrow controls make repositioning content blocks in your emails faster and more precise.

1. Navigate to Email Marketing from the left-hand menu.
2. Open an existing Template or create a new Campaign.
3. Hover over the element (e.g., text, image) or layout block you want to move.
4. Click the up (↑) or down (↓) arrow that appears near the top-left of the section.
5. The element or layout will move instantly to its new position.

## Arrow Controls for Elements vs Layouts

Understanding the difference between elements and layouts helps you use the arrows more effectively.

Arrow controls appear for both:

* Elements: These include individual pieces like text blocks, buttons, or images. The arrows move these items within their current layout.
* Layouts: These are broader sections (e.g., header, body, footer). Arrows here move the entire section up or down within the overall email design.

## Frequently Asked Questions

Q: Do I need to save after each move?  
 No. All changes are automatically saved as you make them.

Q: Can I still use drag-and-drop?  
 Yes. Arrow controls are an enhancement, not a replacement. You can continue to use drag-and-drop alongside the new arrows.

Q: Are arrow controls available on mobile?  
 Currently, this feature is optimized for desktop use.

Q: What if the arrows don't appear?  
 Ensure your mouse is hovering directly over a movable element or layout. If they still don't show, try refreshing the editor or checking for browser updates.
