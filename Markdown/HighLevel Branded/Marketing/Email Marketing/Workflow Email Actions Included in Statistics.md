## **What's Improved:**

* Workflow email stats now under Email Marketing.
* See overall and individual email action stats for a workflow.
* Edit workflows directly from the same screen.

## **How to Use:**

* Go to Email Marketing -> Campaigns -> Workflow Campaigns.
* Click Edit Workflow to access the builder.
* Click Statistics to view workflow stats.
* Use the dropdown to see stats for individual email actions.

## **Note:** 

* The email action creation and syncing with templates/ creating new templates remains unchanged.
