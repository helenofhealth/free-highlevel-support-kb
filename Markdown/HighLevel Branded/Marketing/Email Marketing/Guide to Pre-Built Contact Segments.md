We’re excited to announce a new feature designed to simplify your email marketing efforts: **Pre-Built Contact Segments**. Now, you can easily target specific groups of contacts when sending or scheduling emails, improving your campaign’s effectiveness with just a few clicks.

###   
**What are pre-built segments?**

####   
**Pre-Built Segments** are predefined groups of contacts that allow you to quickly target specific audiences based on their engagement with your emails. Instead of manually sorting through contacts, these segments automatically categorize your audience based on key behaviors, such as recent interactions or lack of engagement.

For example, you can use pre-built segments to:

* Reach contacts who have been **actively engaging** with your emails in the last 7, 30, or 60 days.
* Target contacts who have **interacted** with your last 5 email campaigns.
* Re-engage contacts who have **not interacted** with your recent email campaigns.

By leveraging these pre-built segments, you can ensure your messages are sent to the right audience, making your campaigns more effective and efficient.

###   
**What’s New in Email Builder?**

You can now select from several **pre-built contact segments** directly from the send or schedule screen. These segments include:

* **Contacts engaged within the last 7, 30, or 60 days.**
* **Contacts who interacted with your last 5 email campaigns.**
* **Contacts who did not interact with your last 5 email campaigns.**

_Engaged contacts_ are defined as those who have opened or clicked on emails sent through workflows, bulk actions, or email marketing campaigns.  
_Subscribers_ is same as contacts

###   
**Benefits of this:**

* **Targeted Messaging:** Deliver more relevant content to your most engaged contacts.
* **Customer Retention:** Create dedicated campaigns to re-engage customers who may be at risk of churning.
* **Cost Efficiency:** Save time and resources by not sending emails to disengaged users.

###
