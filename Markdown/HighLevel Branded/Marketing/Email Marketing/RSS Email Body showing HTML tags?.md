**Issue:** RSS Email body shows html tags like this <p>

  
**Fix:** Need to use Custom RSS Item element in the email builder, and instead of using {{rss\_item.content}} use {{{rss\_item.content}}}
  
  
## HTML Based RSS Feed

The values returned by the RSS-based custom variable `{{rss_item.title}}` are HTML-escaped. For example, if the expression contains `&`, then the returned HTML-escaped output is generated as `&amp;` or if your RSS Feed has HTML-based text instead of plain text then it will be rendered as plain text.

If you don't want it to escape a value, use the "triple-stash", `{{{`:

Eg: if your RSS feed source is something like this

without "triple-stash" it will render like this

once you will use "triple-stash" `{{{rss_item.content}}}` it will render like this
