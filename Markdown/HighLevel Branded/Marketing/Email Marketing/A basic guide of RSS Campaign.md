In HighLevel, you can include an RSS feed (Item and Header) in your direct and automated campaigns using the RSS content block. This allows your subscribers to automatically receive and read updates from online content sources, like blog posts and news articles

##   
**How does an RSS Campaign work?**

  
You can insert an RSS item or header element and add your RSS feed URL in the send or schedule section. All feed updates published between the time you schedule the campaign and when the email is sent will be included. You can customise the feed layout by selecting the tags you want to display from the feed.  
  
**Usual RSS Items**  
When you add an RSS Element, depending on what all details are present in your feed, you can use the respective custom values in the builder and it would automatically get the relevant data.  
For Example, if you wish to add blog title and content only,  
  
Step 1: Add a RSS header to your template

Step 2: Ensure we have {{rss\_item.title}} and {{rss\_item.content}}. Depending on what field is needed, add the respective custom values  
Step 3: In your send or schedule section add your RSS URL

Step 4: Schedule your campaign  
  
**Behaviour:** When the campaign is sent, in the template the contact can see all blog titles and content from the day it was scheduled

**FAQs**  
**1\. How to handle a scenario where description is an HTML content?**

The values returned by the RSS-based custom variable `{{rss_item.title}}` are HTML-escaped. For example, if the expression contains `&`, then the returned HTML-escaped output is generated as `&amp;` or if your RSS Feed has HTML-based text instead of plain text then it will be rendered as plain text.

If you don't want it to escape a value, use the "triple-stash", `{{{`:

Eg: if your RSS feed source is something like this

without "triple-stash" it will render like this

once you will use "triple-stash" `{{{rss_item.content}}}` it will render like this

**2\. What content can I expect in the next month RSS Campaign?**  
  
If you have created the campaign on March 10th and scheduled it for March 25th, all blog posts after March 10 would be part of the campaign on March 25th.   
If you want to limit the number of posts, in the send or schedule give the maximum number of feeds. If a user specifies "5", we will show most recent 5 blogs in the campaign.   
  
**3\. What will happen if I have no blogs after the RSS campaign was scheduled.**   
In the next cycle, no campaign would be sent. You can review the same from audit log where you can find an entry of unsuccessful schedule due to no new feeds.
