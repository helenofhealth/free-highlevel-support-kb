With the new feature in our platform, you can now easily **pause** or **cancel** your scheduled email campaigns, including A/B tests. This functionality ensures you have full control over your campaigns, allowing you to make changes or corrections before they are sent.

####   
**What campaigns does it work for?**  
It works for all scheduled, batch schedule and A/B test campaign that was scheduled.   
  
**When to Use It:**

* **Pause a Campaign:** Use this option if you need more time to review or make last-minute changes to your email campaign before it goes live. Pausing a campaign gives you the flexibility to resume it at any time.
* **Cancel a Campaign:** Cancel a campaign if you decide not to send it at all. This is particularly useful if you spot critical errors or if the campaign is no longer relevant. Canceling a campaign stops all future sends, including any batches or automated RSS emails.

   * Select **Cancel** to completely stop the campaign. This will prevent it from being sent, including any RSS or batch emails.
