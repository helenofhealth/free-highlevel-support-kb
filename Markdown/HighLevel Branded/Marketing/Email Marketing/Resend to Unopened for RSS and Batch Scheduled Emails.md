You now have more control when it comes to reconnecting with contacts who didn’t open your emails. Previously, the Resend to Unopened feature was limited to “Send Now” campaigns—leaving RSS and Batch Schedule campaigns without a simple way to re-engage missed recipients. With this update, you can now use Resend to Unopened for RSS and Batch Schedule campaigns, giving you greater flexibility to maximize your email reach and improve engagement rates.

## **What’s New?**

* Support for RSS Campaigns
* Support for Batch Scheduled Campaigns
* Boost your campaign performance by re-engaging contacts who didn’t open your emails
* Simple interface with custom subject lines and scheduled resend times

## **Why It Matters**

Before this update, users could only resend unopened emails using the “Send Now” campaign type. This limitation prevented those using scheduled email flows (like RSS feeds and batch scheduling) from taking advantage of a powerful engagement tool.

  
Now, whether you’re sending weekly newsletters or batch-planned campaigns, you can follow up with your audience more effectively—without switching campaign types.

* Don’t resend too soon — give your audience time to open the original email
* Monitor engagement metrics post-resend to refine your strategy
