### **What Is Conditional Sending?**

**Conditional Sending lets you show or hide content blocks based on your contacts’ custom field data. This means you can tailor email content to each recipient and display a default value if a field (like First Name) isn’t filled in.**

  
### **Benefits**

* **Professionalism:** Avoids blanks or missing information in greetings and messages.
* **Personalisation:** Ensures each recipient sees a relevant, friendly greeting—even if some data is missing.
* **Consistency:** Maintains a uniform look and feel across all emails, regardless of data quality.
* **Higher Engagement:** Personalised emails are more likely to be opened and read.
