When you integrate your Facebook account with Ad Manager, we ask for some necessary permissions to access your Business page.

  
Prerequisite for Ad Manager


Have a Facebook Page (Learn how to create Facebook Page - <https://www.facebook.com/business/help/1199464373557428?id=418112142508425>)
  
  
When you first set up your Facebook Ads account with Ad Manager, you are asked to grant LeadConnector permissions to access and manage the Facebook Business account where you'll run campaigns.

####   
**To give permissions from Ad Manager :**

1. Go to Marketing > Ad Manager![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155026222746/original/tGt31CQEF8nMH_RFBFXP4fcHvm7qcvY1JQ.png?1715971864)
2. Click the option to Connect Now.  
Note - If you have already connected the account in Subaccount Settings > Integration, it will show all the pages where you are the admin to.
3. Click **Connect to Facebook** by adding the username and password and granting the relevant permissions. Make sure all the toggles are enabled and checkboxes selected.
4. Once the permissions are granted to LeadConnector app, the next step is to identify the pages you would like to connect if you have multiple business pages.

**Troubleshoot if the page is not found while connecting in Ad Manager**

  
When setting up a campaign, Ad Manager needs permissions for the Facebook Business page where you want to run the ads. If the page doesn't appear while connecting the page in Ad Manager, it means some permissions are missing or you are missing permission of admin.   
Below is the permission checklist that needs to be provided to LeadConnector to use Ad Manager without any hiccup.

  
**Facebook Permissions Checklist:**

Admin Permissions:

* Admin privileges of the page you wish to connect are required.
* Admin privileges can be managed in the Page Setup of your Facebook page's professional dashboard menu.
* If your Facebook page is part of a Meta Business Portfolio, admin privileges can be managed in Settings > Accounts > Pages of your Meta Business Suite.

Note: If the page is owned by a different Meta Business Manager account, you'll need to reach out to an admin of that Business Manager account.

  
Integration Permissions:

â€¢ When connecting your Facebook Page, allow all permissions in order to use Ad Manager.

3. Adjust the settings by checking or unchecking the boxes next to your information. In order to use Ad Manager seamlessly we recommend to give all the permissions to LeadConnector by checking in the checkboxes or toggle ON the permissions in the view and edit dialog.  
The granular permissions which are necessary for Ad Manager are as follows:  
Manage your business - should be toggled ON  
Access leads for your Pages - should be toggled ON  
Show a list of the Pages you manage - should be toggled ON  
Manage ads for ad accounts that you have access to - should be toggled ON  
When you're finished click **Save**.
* Note - If at any time you decide to remove mandatory permissions it will disconnect your Facebook account. You must reconnect before editing or starting a new campaign. Any live ad campaigns will continue running as usual.
