In this article, we will be describing how to set a connected Facebook page from the list of all the connected pages as the default page. This page will be considered as the choice of page to publish new ad campaigns.

  
Note: During the campaign creation process, user will have the option to select any page which they want the ad campaign to be published on. The concept of setting a page as default stemmed from the fact that there should be a default selected page in the campaign builder flow which is open to be changed by the user as and when desired.

On click of the 'Set as default' button, the corresponding page will be set as the default page and the earlier selected default page will no longer be the default choice to publish a new ad campaign.

  
Few points specific to setting a page as default:

  
1. During the onboarding flow, when user connects the first Facebook page with Ad Manager then that page will be considered as the default page.
2. If user deletes an already connected page which is set as default, the next page automatically becomes default.
3. There can be only one default page out of all connected Facebook pages.

  
**Note**: During the campaign creation process, user will have the option to select any page which they want the ad campaign to be published on. The concept of setting a page as default stemmed from the fact that there should be a default selected page in the campaign builder flow which is open to be changed by the user as and when desired.
