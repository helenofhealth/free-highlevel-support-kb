When your client purchases Ad Manager it creates a subscription in the System which is between your client's card & your Stripe Account so you can collect payment from your clients.

  
When your client clicks the Pay and Subscribe button the system will create the subscription, process the payment, and take them to the Ad Manager onboarding flow.

  
**Note:** This is a monthly subscription amount which agency charges from sub-accounts to use Ad Manager and publish unlimited campaigns. Payment for the campaign will be charged from the card on file under Meta Ad account, added by the user once campaign is approved by the ad publishing platform to be published.
