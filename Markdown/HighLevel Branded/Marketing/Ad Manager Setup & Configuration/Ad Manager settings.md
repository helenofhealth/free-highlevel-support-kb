## **Platform Settings -** **Meta**

  
The Meta section includes four key tabs:

####   

1\. **Ad Account**

* Displays connected Meta Ad Account with name, account ID, status, and currency.
* You can delete the account to reset the setup. On deletion:  
   * All campaigns become hidden (not deleted).  
   * You’ll be redirected to the onboarding screen to reconnect a Meta account.  
   * Reconnecting the same ad account restores all data.

2\. **Pages**

* View all connected Facebook Pages.
* Add new pages using **"Connect Facebook Page(s)"**. Only those pages that are part of the connected Facebook account will be available to be connected.
* Delete a page by clicking the trash icon beside it. This will:  
   * Unlink the page.  
   * Retain previously published ads (which can no longer be edited from HighLevel).  
   * Restore campaign visibility if the page is reconnected.
