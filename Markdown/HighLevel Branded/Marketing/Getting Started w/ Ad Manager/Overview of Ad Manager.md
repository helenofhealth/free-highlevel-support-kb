## **Pre-requisites for Ad Manager**

  
Few Prerequisite for Ad Manager -   
  
1. Selection of a pricing model from Agency view > Reselling is the first step in theÂ Ad Manager journey. It is best to set the reselling offer of Ad Manager to sub-accounts before proceeding further.  
  
2. Toggling ON/OFF Ad Manager for a sub-account will ensure the visibility of Ad Manager tab under sub-account > marketing. It is ON by default for all the sub-accounts with 'Standard Plan' as the default pricing model.
