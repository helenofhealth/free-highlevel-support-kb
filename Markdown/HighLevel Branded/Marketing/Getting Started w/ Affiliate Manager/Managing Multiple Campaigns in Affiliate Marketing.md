## **Why Use Campaigns?**

Campaigns allow you to tailor promotions and incentives for different products or audiences. You might create separate campaigns for:

* A specific website or funnel

This level of segmentation helps you manage your affiliate relationships more effectively and offer targeted rewards.

## **Managing Affiliates Across Multiple Campaigns**

Affiliates can participate in multiple campaigns at the same time, giving them the flexibility to promote various products or services. As a campaign manager, you have full control to:

* **Invite** affiliates to join specific campaigns.
* **Add** affiliates directly to a campaign, either individually or in bulk.
* **Remove** affiliates from a campaign when necessary.

This flexibility allows you to adjust your strategy as your business evolves, ensuring that affiliates are always working within the most relevant campaign.

* Take action to optimize your campaigns and boost your overall sales.

Managing multiple campaigns ensures that you stay organized and can scale your affiliate program effectively.
