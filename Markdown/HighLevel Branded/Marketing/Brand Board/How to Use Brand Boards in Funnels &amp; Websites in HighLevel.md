Brand Boards are here to make your life easier by simplifying the process of maintaining consistent brand guidelines across your funnels and websites. This article explains how to use Brand Boards to manage and apply your brand’s colors effectively.  
  
  
**Why Use Brand Boards in Funnels and Websites?**

1. **Saves Time**: No more hunting for the right color or remembering HEX codes. Brand Boards streamline your workflow.
2. **Default and Custom Colors**: Easily manage both default and custom colors for quick edits and consistent branding.
3. **Eye Dropper Tool**: Utilize the new eye dropper tool to pick colors directly from your design.

**When to Use Different Color Options?**

1. **Brand Colors**: Use these for colors you want to be consistent across all pages and products. Brand Colors ensure uniformity throughout your funnel or website.
2. **Default Colors**: These are system defaults that remain static regardless of brand colors or page-specific settings. Use Default Colors for elements that shouldn’t change with different brand themes.
3. **Custom Colors**: These are page-specific colors you create and manage at a granular level. Custom Colors allow you to apply updates across past and current elements on a page.
