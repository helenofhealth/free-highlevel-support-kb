# **What is the Link Shortener?**

  
The Link Shortener is a built-in feature within Social Planner that automatically converts long, complex URLs into shorter, more manageable links in your post preview. While the full URL remains visible in your content editor, the shortened link is displayed in the live preview and in the published post itself.

  
This functionality helps improve the overall readability and visual appeal of your social content, especially when sharing URLs from blogs, landing pages, or external websites.

## **Notes About the Link Shortener**

  
**Understand how the Link Shortener behaves and what features are planned for future release.**

 • **Click Tracking Is Coming**: Analytics that show how many users clicked on your shortened links are currently in development and will be available in a future update.

 • **Auto Conversion**: You don’t need to manually replace the link—just click the shortener icon, and it does the rest for you.
