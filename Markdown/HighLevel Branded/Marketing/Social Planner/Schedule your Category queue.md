What’s a Category queue?

A category queue is a **powerful way** to plan your evergreen content by re-purposing the already published and future content tagged to a certain category to be re-utilised for publishing on the platforms or add new category with new content. 

This would allow us to not just be able to schedule a specific post, but a whole category of posts and the system would cycle through all of the posts until the end and then reset and start again.
