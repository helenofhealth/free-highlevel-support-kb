# **Facebook Pages not showing in the lis** **t**

It is important to connect your Facebook account with all of the permissions. The main reasons are as follows   
  
1\. **Content Permission is missing, I have permission through business manager -** The user needs to have admin rights to the Facebook page, we don't recommend the business manager. Social Planner requires content and insight permission while connection.  
  
2\. **My Page is missing, I am admin -** The user who has connected the initial integration didn't grant permission to all the Facebook pages. Later on, they would like to add another page, when they go to Social Planner > Settings > Integration, while adding authenticating they are not able to see the other page.   
  
**Content Permission is missing, I have permission through business manager**  
  
## **1.** Navigate to Facebook:

Step 1 - Login to your Facebook account of the page.

Step 4 - In left panel, look for "Page Access"

Step 5 - Check if you are listed like Hightest > Page name, you would be required to ask the owner/admin of the page to add the person who would like to connect and publish in Social Planner.

**If the page doesn't have People with Facebook access as the person who owns the page. They can try to do this** 
1\. They should invite someone else as an admin with full access.  
Note - **Disclaimer to be added on point: If the page doesn't have People with Facebook access as the person who owns the page. They can try to do this - Send them a friend request, it will help you out while you are searching the name.**  
2\. That person should invite the admin who owns the page in people with Facebook access (full access).  
3\. Optional, they can remove the initial person who was added once the admin has full permissions.

# **Facebook Post Failed to Publish**

We have listed down the reasons for the most common errors that you face while publishing content to Facebook and start scratching your head why the content did not appear, but with errors such as:
  
  
## **1.** Abusive /Reported Content/Link Goes Against Community Standard:

Your message couldn't be sent because it includes content that other people on Facebook have reported as abusive or not appropriate. Your content couldn't be shared, because this link goes against our Community Standards of Facebook.

##   
**2\.** Error validating access token:

  
The session has been invalidated because the admin has changed their password or Facebook has changed the session for security reasons. Your session/access token to Facebook has expired. This happens if you have:

* Changed your account password.
* You have not made a post to Facebook in the past 90 days from Social Planner
  
  
## **3.** Two Factor Authentication:

If the business page that you are managing has enabled two-factor authentication, you need to enable the Two-factor authentication on your account level. After that reconnect your account and you will not be facing this error.

The user must be an administrator, editor, or moderator of the page in order to impersonate it.
  
  
## **4\.** 'manage\_permissions' must be granted:

If you are publishing content to your client's social media pages and they have added you as an administrator, in such a case, you will be getting this error. Make sure, you have the administration access to those social media pages and while connecting the account, you allow the manage\_permissions to the Pages section so your post publishes without any issues.
  
  
## **5.** Missing or Invalid Image:

If you have scheduled the social media posts, and the link that you are sharing with the image is no longer opening, you will be getting this error for your social post.
  
  
## **6.** An unknown error occurred: 

If you are getting this error, then the issue most likely is that your Facebook page access token does not have enough permission to publish content. Sometimes, your posts are published, but a few times they are failed. If you are facing this issue, what you need to do is reconnect your pages and make sure you have given all of the permissions while connecting your Facebook Page.
  
  
## **7.** The URL you supplied is invalid or this link could not be posted:

When we publish a message that includes a link to the message, Facebook takes a look at this link and indexes it. When Facebook servers are overloaded they can’t index it during the request time. Facebook throws one of the errors mentioned above. Facebook still indexes the link, so the second try a couple of minutes later usually goes without any problems.
  
  
## **8.** I'm unable to reconnect a page/group in the Social Planner:  
  
##    
**![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155025796538/original/bu77nUYSJQKo-ekttxuqFAbDXplG0hEZbg.jpeg?1715280209)**
  
  
To reconnect a page/group **within** the social planner tab, please reconnect using thesame User's social media account that originally connected the page/group to the location**or** have the current user head into the **locations Settings > Integrations >** Click on **disconnect, then the connect button** for the accounts with expired tokens. 

  
They will need to be a page admin to continue. Once done, head back into the social planner and check to see if the social token is still expired.
  
  
**For example:**   
  
For Example : If Emily had connected the Facebook page using her account, now Alex (Account Admin) wants to reconnect the page because the integration has expired, then Alex will need to use Emily's Facebook account to reconnect the page, or ask Emily to reconnect the page herself using her account within the social planner settings **( gear icon ) > integrations > Disconnect,** then reconnect Social pages where you are seeing expired tokens.
