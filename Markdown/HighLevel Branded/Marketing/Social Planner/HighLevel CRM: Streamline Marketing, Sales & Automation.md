# **Facebook Page Publishing Setup Guide**

Following the steps below, you will be able to connect your Facebook pages with the platform.

  
1\. If you have already connected your Facebook pages from any profile previously and want to add some new pages, you will have to **'Remove'** the application from your **Facebook Settings > Business Integration** section on your Facebook account and follow the steps below all over again as demonstrated in the image below. 

  
2\. To add all your Facebook pages, it is necessary that you have **Admin rights.** **It is mandatory for you to log yourself in with the same profile that has all the pages in which you are an admin.**

  
Due to Facebook's recent API changes, it will no **longer promote posting to Facebook personal profiles, however, you can add pages from different profiles for Social Planner.**
