   2. Examples of Review Posting -  
   Example 1 - If you have connected your GMB Page, imagine that you received new review on 1st January 2024 6PM and inside Social Planner, if you have set that you would like to post 5 social posts per day at 8:37 AM. The new review will get published next day 2nd January 2024 at 8:37 AM. If you have received more than 5 reviews, it will select based on star and post only 5 social posts on selected socials.  
         
   Example 2 - If the client sets the review automation frequency to ‘Every week’ with a post count of 3, starting on October 22, 2024, at 11 AM, it means that 3 reviews will be posted weekly (every 7th day from the creation date).  
   From above example, on October 29, 2024, 3 reviews will be published at 11 AM, provided that 3 reviews are available between the creation and execution times.  
   The maximum post count does not mean posting three times in a single week. It means posting 3 reviews on the same day. This is why only one scheduled review card is displayed on the calendar.  
   The same logic applies to all frequency types, whether the frequency is set to daily, weekly, or monthly.

  
**Important Notes:**

1. We fetch and publish Google reviews that were posted after the date you created the review automation. Reviews added before the automation setup date will not be considered.
2. We only publish reviews that include written text. Reviews that contain only a star rating (without any written content) will be skipped automatically.
3. If no eligible new reviews are found at the time of execution, the post will be skipped. The system may automatically attempt to publish on the next scheduled date if the automation is set to repeat.
4. The time you choose while scheduling review posts follows your local timezone settings. However, internal systems may display times in UTC or server time (e.g., Los Angeles time) this does not affect the actual publishing time.
5. To connect your Facebook page(s), navigate to Reputation > Settings > Integration and add your Facebook page URL.
