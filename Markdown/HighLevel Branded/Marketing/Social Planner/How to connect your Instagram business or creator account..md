**2)** **Confirm that you have an Admin or Editor Page role for the Facebook Page if it's a Classic Page type or Facebook access with full or partial control on a New Page type. See the Facebook help article. [How do I see what my role is on a Facebook Page](https://www.facebook.com/help/510247025775149)?**
