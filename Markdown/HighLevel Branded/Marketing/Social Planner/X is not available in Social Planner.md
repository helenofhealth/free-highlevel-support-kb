On December 4, 2024, our integration with X (formerly Twitter) was disabled. Due to this change you will no longer be able to create, schedule, or post directly to X using the Social Planner. 

  
#### **What Does This Mean for You?**

* Posting to X (formerly Twitter) via the Social Planner is no longer possible. Users will not be able to connect to X in the Connections tab.
* All other social media integrations (e.g., Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, Google Business Profile, TikTok) remain fully supported and operational.

  
#### **Why Is This Happening?**

[ X's integration requirements have recently undergone significant changes](https://x.com/API/status/1693760591503266165). The new migration requirement would have added a significant monthly fee which would have resulted in a large cost passed on to customers. After working diligently to come to a reasonable agreement that would have exempted us and our users from this cost increase, we were unfortunately unable to do so. 

  
While we are disappointed in having to remove our X integration, our efforts remain focused on refining the Social Planner and improving support for all other integrations.  
  
Our view is that X remains a vital platform in the social media landscape. We will continue to monitor changes in their API requirements, in hopes that we can re-integrate and allow posts to be scheduled and managed on X through the Social Planner in the future.

**FAQs**

  
1. What would be the additional cost to retain X as an option in the Social Planner?  
The platform costs would be $42,000/month ($504,000/year) for keeping access of X with the newly required enterprise V2 X API.
2. Is it possible to implement a solution that would incorporate individual API keys for X accounts?  
The “bring your own API key” method is technically possible, but we don’t view this as a long-term solution.
