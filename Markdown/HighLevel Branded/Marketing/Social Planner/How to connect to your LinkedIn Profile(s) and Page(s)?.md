## **Configuring the LinkedIn Integration**

  
Before you begin setting up LinkedIn, make sure you have **admin access to the LinkedIn Page** you want to connect. The integration token is valid for approximately **60 days**, after which you’ll see a **“Reconnect” prompt** to renew access. If the connection fails due to missing permissions, the account will display a **“Permissions Missing”** status—simply follow the setup steps again to reauthorize the connection successfully.

  
### **Navigate to the Social Planner**

  
From the left sidebar, go to Marketing > Social Planner. This is where you manage all your scheduled content across connected social platforms.

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

  
**Q: Can I connect both a LinkedIn profile and a business page at the same time?**

Yes, HighLevel allows you to connect multiple LinkedIn accounts—both personal profiles and business pages—based on available access and permissions.

  
**Q: What happens if my LinkedIn connection expires?**

If the token expires, you will see a “Reconnect” prompt in the Social Accounts tab. Simply click it and reauthorize via LinkedIn.

  
**Q: Why does it say “Permissions Missing” for my page?**

This usually means your LinkedIn account does not have admin rights on the page or certain permissions were not granted during authorization. Reconnect and ensure full access is provided.

  
**Q: Can I schedule LinkedIn posts for both personal and company pages?**

Yes, once both are connected, you can select where to publish each post during the content creation process.

  
**Q: Is there a limit to how many LinkedIn accounts I can connect?**

While there’s no fixed limit in HighLevel, the number of accounts you manage should align with your subscription tier and admin permissions.
