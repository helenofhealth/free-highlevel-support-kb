1\. Date and Time Column: \[Both\]  
 In this column, you can type in the date and time when you want to share your post. In this column, you must format the date exactly how you see it at the top of the column:  
  
* Use the 24-hour format. Example: 2025-08-25 21:30
* If the date column is empty, it will be considered in the Draft.
* The Column Header of this column must be exactly as mentioned in the Sample CSV as shown in the video, it should be as follows: postAtSpecificTime YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm, YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:ss, YYYY/MM/DD HH:mm:ss, YYYY/MM/DD HH:mm, M/D/YYYY H:mm:ss, and M/D/YYYY H:mm
* It is highly recommended to have all the scheduled times be at least 10 minutes after the time when you are uploading the CSV. For example, if the scheduled date/time for the post is 2023-10-14 15:00. This means that the CSV should be uploaded no later than October 14th, 2023 at 2:50PM.
