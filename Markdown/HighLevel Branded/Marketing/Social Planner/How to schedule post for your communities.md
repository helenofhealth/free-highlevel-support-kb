Important points to note ? 

\- If there are new Channels or changes to Group/Channel details, it will not auto-populate in Social Planner. The user will have to go to Social Planner Settings > Communities to re-sync the groups and channels.

\- In Post Composer area, there is option to add user on whose name the post will be published. In Social Planner Settings > there will be option to go to Communities > you can select default users who will be used when you create new social post.
