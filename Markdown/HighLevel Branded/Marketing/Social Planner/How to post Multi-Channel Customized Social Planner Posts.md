The "Customize for Each Post" feature is an innovative tool that allows marketers, businesses, and individuals to create and manage tailored content for different social media channels, all within one interface. Here's a thorough understanding of what the feature entails:

  
**Multi-Platform Compatibility:** This feature enables users to select multiple social media platforms (such as Facebook, LinkedIn etc.) and customize the content according to the specific character limitations and requirements of each platform.

**Toggle Switch:** A simple toggle switch allows users to switch between customized content for different channels and standardized content that applies across all selected platforms. This ensures flexibility in content creation and delivery.

  
**AI Integration:** The integration with Content AI means users can leverage artificial intelligence to generate content up to 900 words, adapting it to different content sizes (small, medium, and large) based on the type of social media being used.

  
**Scheduling Capability:** Not only can you create customized posts, but you can also schedule them for a later time, automating your social media management process.

  
**Cost-Effective and Time-Efficient:** This feature minimizes the effort needed to create separate posts for different platforms, saving time and resources and ensuring a cohesive yet customized marketing approach.
