# **What is an Instagram Collaborator Post?**

  
Instagram Collaborator Posts (Collab Posts) allow two accounts to share the same post in their feed or Reels. This joint-posting feature increases visibility and engagement by showing the content to both users’ audiences, making it perfect for partnerships, influencer campaigns, or brand collaborations.

## **How To Use Instagram Collaborator Posts in Social Planner**
  
  
Learn how to set up and schedule Instagram Collab posts using HighLevel’s Social Planner so they appear on both your account and your collaborator’s.

  
**Step-by-Step Instructions**  
  
 1\. **Go to Marketing → Social Planner**

Navigate to the left-hand menu and click **Marketing**, then select **Social Planner**.

 2\. **Connect Your Instagram Account**

Click the **gear icon** next to “New Post” to open Social Planner Settings.

If your Instagram account isn’t connected yet, click **Add Account** and complete the connection process.

 3\. **Click “New Post” to Create Content**

 • Select your Instagram profile from the list of connected accounts.

 • Add your caption, hashtags, location, and any images or videos for the post.

 4\. **Choose Post Type: Feed or Reel**

For Collaborator posts to work, the content **must be posted as a Feed or Reel**.

Use the dropdown menu to select the correct post format.

 5\. **Add a Collaborator**

Scroll to the **Collaborator** section and enter the **exact Instagram handle** of the person or brand you wish to collaborate with (e.g., @partneraccount).

 6\. **Schedule or Publish Your Post**

 • Choose a publish date and time, or click **Post Now**.

 • Once live, your collaborator will receive a notification on Instagram to accept the invite.

 • After accepting, the post will appear on both accounts’ feeds or Reels tabs.

## **Instagram Collaborator Post Settings**

  
To ensure your collaborator posts go live without issues, follow these requirements:

 • **Post Type Requirement:** Only **Feed** and **Reels** support collaboration — Stories and Carousels are not supported.

 • **Correct Instagram Handle:** Enter the handle exactly as it appears. Invalid handles will result in failure to invite.

 • **No Pre-Approval in HighLevel:** Collaborator invites are managed entirely on Instagram, after the post is published.

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

  
**Q: Can I tag multiple collaborators in one post?**

A: No, Instagram currently allows only **one collaborator** per post using the Collab feature.

  
**Q: What happens if the collaborator doesn’t accept the invite?**

A: The post will still appear on your Instagram profile, but will not be visible on the collaborator’s profile unless they accept the collaboration request.

  
**Q: Can I schedule a Collaborator post in advance?**

A: Yes! Collaborator posts can be scheduled just like any other Instagram post in Social Planner. The collaborator will be notified when it goes live.

  
**Q: Does the collaborator need to be connected in Social Planner?**

A: No. The collaborator only needs to have a valid Instagram handle. The collaboration happens natively on Instagram after the post is published.

  
**Q: Can I edit the collaborator after posting?**

A: No. The collaborator must be set **before** publishing. You cannot modify collaborators after the post is live.

  
**Q: Does this work for Instagram Business and Creator accounts?**

A: Yes. Both account types support the Collaborator feature as long as they’re eligible for Collab posts on Instagram.
