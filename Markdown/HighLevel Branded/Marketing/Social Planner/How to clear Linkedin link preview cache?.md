Shared your website link on LinkedIn with incorrect link preview title, description or image? After updating your website with perfect preview content and image, if you try sharing your website link you will still see old preview content and image. That's because LinkedIn caches link preview content for 7 days.

  
**Solution:**

  
LinkedIn has launched the Post Inspector. You have to do the following to clear LinkedIn Preview cache:

  
Step 1: Visit <https://www.linkedin.com/post-inspector/>

  
Step 2: Enter your URL and click on Inspect, You will see the updated preview image

  
Step 3: Now try sharing your URL on LinkedIn

  
Hope this helps!
