Social Planner now offers a powerful new feature: users can upload PDF's and post them as photos in a carousel on LinkedIn. Additionally, users can import PDFs and convert each page into separate images for posting on LinkedIn and other social platforms.

The LinkedIn PDF Carousel has become one of the most popular formats for sharing information, providing a unique way to engage your audience and showcase expertise.

2. PDFs are converted into images when imported in social planner, and if Instagram is selected, the images are automatically cropped to adhere to Instagram's aspect ratio constraints.
3. Users can now delete media by clicking the 'X' that appears when hovering over the media preview.
4. When user selects post as a PDF option, all the images are converted into a PDF and posted to LinkedIn.
