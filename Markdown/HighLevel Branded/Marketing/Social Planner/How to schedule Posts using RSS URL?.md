## **Benefits of Automatic Social Posts From RSS Feed**

  
RSS (Really Simple Syndication) can be a valuable tool for managing and curating content in social media. Here are some ways RSS can help in social media:  
  
* **Content Curation**: RSS allows you to aggregate content from various sources into one feed. This makes it easier to discover relevant and interesting content to share on social media.
* **Automated Content Sharing:** You can set up RSS feeds to automatically post content to your social media accounts. This can save time and ensure a consistent flow of content.
* **Stay Updated with Industry Trends**: By subscribing to RSS feeds of industry-specific blogs and news sites, you can stay up-to-date with the latest trends, news, and developments. This helps in creating timely and relevant social media posts.
* **Reduce Information Overload**: Instead of manually browsing through numerous websites and social media platforms, RSS consolidates content in one place. This helps in efficiently managing information.
* **Share User-Generated Content**: If you have a community or forum, you can set up RSS feeds to monitor user-generated content. This allows you to easily share and promote content created by your community members.
* **Maintain a Consistent Posting Schedule**:By using scheduling tools along with RSS feeds, you can maintain a consistent posting schedule even during busy times.

## **How to find the RSS Feed?**

  
RSS feeds are still very much alive, though they may be a bit trickier to locate these days. Unlike in the past, browsers no longer highlight them, and websites don't always prominently display RSS links. However, the majority of sites do offer RSS feeds. Let's explore some quick ways to find them when a simple Google search isn't enough.

  
For instance, a substantial number of websites are built using WordPress, accounting for over 40% of the web. This means there's a high likelihood that the website you're visiting is a WordPress site, and they typically offer easily discoverable RSS feeds.  
  
  
To find a WordPress RSS feed, just add "/feed" to the end of the URL. For instance, <https://justinpot.com/feed>. This method works in most cases and is my go-to approach for finding RSS feeds.  
  
If this doesn't yield results, here are a few additional tricks to try on other types of sites:

* For sites hosted on Tumblr, append "/rss" to the URL. For example: <https://example.tumblr.com/rss>.
* On Blogger-hosted sites, tack on "feeds/posts/default" to the end of the URL. For example: [example.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default](//example.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default).
* If a publication is on Medium, insert "/feed/" before the publication's name. So, [medium.com/example-site](http://medium.com/example-site) becomes [medium.com/feed/example-site](//medium.com/feed/example-site).
* YouTube channel pages can serve as RSS feeds. Just copy and paste the channel's URL into your RSS reader.
* You can also find an OPML file containing all your subscriptions there.

If none of these methods prove successful, you can resort to checking a webpage's source code. Don't worry, it's simpler than it sounds.

  
Right-click on an empty space on the website where you'd like to find an RSS feed, then select "View Page Source" (the phrasing might vary slightly depending on your browser).

Next, search the code by pressing Ctrl+F (Windows, Linux) or Command+F (Mac). Start with a search for "rss," like so:

If "rss" doesn't yield results, try "atom" instead. Look for an RSS URL, as shown above, then copy and paste it into your feed reader. Happy feed hunting!

**Step 6:** Select Maximum Posts

* Select how many unique posts should be fetched from your RSS feed each time it checks for new content (minimum 1 to maximum 5).

  
* For example, if you choose '3', the system will pull up to the 3 most recent items from the RSS feed at the time of posting.
* This does not mean the same post will be published multiple times. Each fetched item will be published once as its own social post.
