## **Where to find the option to create custom audiences?**

  
The option to create custom audiences can be found at two places within Ad Manager:

**1.** In the campaign creation flow, the second step is about 'Budget and Audience', under Audience Controls section we have the Intended Audience section.

## **What is Customer List Custom Audience?**

  
### **Overview**

The **Meta Customer List Custom Audience** is a targeting option that allows businesses to upload their own customer data (such as email addresses, phone numbers, or other identifiers) into Ad Manager. Facebook then matches this data with user profiles on the platform to create a custom audience for ad targeting. Here’s a breakdown of what one should know:

  
### **Key Offerings**

1. **Audience Creation**: You can create a Custom Audience by uploading a list of customer data (like emails, phone numbers, etc.) that you’ve collected, for example, from your website, CRM system, or newsletter sign-ups.
2. **Data Matching**: Facebook matches the data you upload with its user profiles to create a list of people who are active on the platform. This allows you to target those specific individuals with ads.
3. **Ad Targeting**: Once you’ve created your Custom Audience, you can target these users with highly relevant ads. This is useful for re-engaging existing customers, promoting offers, or encouraging repeat business.
4. **Privacy and Compliance**: Facebook ensures that data is handled securely and according to privacy regulations (like GDPR). Businesses should only upload customer data they have permission to use for advertising.
5. **Audience Segmentation**: You can segment your audience by various factors, such as recent buyers, high-value customers, or inactive customers, allowing you to run more personalised ad campaigns.
6. **Lookalike Audiences**: Once you have a Custom Audience, you can create a **Lookalike Audience**, where Facebook finds users who share similar characteristics to your existing customers. This helps expand your reach to potential new customers who are more likely to be interested in your business.
7. **Customer List Format**: The customer data needs to be in a specific format (CSV), with proper identifiers such as email addresses, phone numbers, or other relevant information.

  
### **Benefits**

* **Precise targeting** of existing customers.
* **Increased conversion rates** by showing ads to people who already have a relationship with your brand.
* **Re-engagement** with past customers who might have forgotten about your business.

In summary, a **Facebook Customer List Custom Audience** is a powerful way to reach existing customers on Facebook, increase ad relevance, and improve the performance of your campaigns.

There are 2 options under customer list custom audience to choose and select the customers:  
1\. CSV upload  
2\. Use smart lists

### **CSV Upload**

  
**Click to upload:** User need to upload the list of customers in the CSV format by adhering to the formatting guidelines and/or using the sample file as reference.

  
The **formatting guidelines** are the specifics defined by Meta as to how the file should be with all the relevant details to create a custom audience. On click of the 'Formatting Guidelines' button, user is navigated to the Meta guidelines page. <https://www.facebook.com/business/help/2082575038703844?id=2469097953376494>

  
A sample file is provided for reference to give an idea as to how the data should be before uploading it for most optimal result. One can download it by clicking on the '**Download Sample**' button.  

  
### **Use Smart Lists**

  
Select the Smart List option and choose one or many existing smart lists from the dropdown.

Only the smart lists which are pre-created from the contacts section of the sub-account will be available to create a custom audience. **Refer the [help doc](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/48001062094-getting-started-with-smart-lists) to understand how to create a contacts smart list.**

  
The total number of contacts that will be part of the audience set is shown below the 'Select Smart List' dropdown.

  
Add an **audience name** and **description** for easy distinction.  

  
Once all the details are entered, click on '**Create Audience**' button to create a customer list custom audience.

  
**Note:** Once a custom audience is successfully created, it will be shown as part of the Retargeting Audience dropdown list and part of the audience list under audiences tab. It can be used for creating a campaign once the status of the newly created audience is **ready**.

### **Important Notes:**

1. If the format of the uploaded file isn't correct or not in accordance to the guidelines, the file upload will fail with an error message.

2. Only the contacts included in the selected smart lists **at the time of audience creation** will be considered part of the audience.
3. Before an audience gets created, user needs to accept the customer list **custom audience TOS** from Meta. A toast message specifying the same will be shown to those users who haven't accepted the terms on click of 'Create Audience'.
