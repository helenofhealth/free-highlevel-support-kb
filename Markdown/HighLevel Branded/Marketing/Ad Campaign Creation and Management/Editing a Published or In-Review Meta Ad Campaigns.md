## **Why to edit a Published campaign?**

  
Editing a live campaign allows users to adapt to real-time performance data, market conditions, and business needs. It ensures the campaign remains effective and relevant throughout its duration. With this functionality, users can:

* Correct errors made during the initial campaign setup.
* Optimise campaign performance based on insights from key performance indicators (KPIs).
* Respond dynamically to feedback, improving ad content or audience targeting.
* Save time by avoiding the need to pause a campaign and create a new one for minor adjustments.

  
This feature empowers users to refine their campaigns for better results without disrupting their ongoing advertising efforts.

* Locate the live or in-review campaign you want to edit.
* Click on the **Edit** option available in the inline ellipsis menu for the campaign.
