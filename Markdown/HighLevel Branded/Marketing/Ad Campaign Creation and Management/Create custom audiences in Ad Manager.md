## **How to create a custom audience?**

  
This type of target audience refers to a group of people who are familiar with your brand/product and have interacted with it earlier at some point in any of the Meta platform. We will be using custom audience curated especially to target these set of people with our ad campaign.

Creation of a custom audience is a two step process, both the steps are listed as follows:

1. On clicking the '**Create a Custom Audience**' button, a modal dialog opens up allowing users to select a custom audience source that will be used to create a custom audience depending on the source selected.

2. Once a source is chosen and user clicks on '**Next**', they will be navigated to the second step of custom audience creation and a dialog is presented with its constituents depending on which source is selected.  
    
Ex: If '**Website**' is selected, the second step to create a custom audience will look like -

**Audience retention:** It refers to the number of days users will remain in your audience after they have interacted with your content. In case of Website audience, 30 days is the maximum allowed limit.
