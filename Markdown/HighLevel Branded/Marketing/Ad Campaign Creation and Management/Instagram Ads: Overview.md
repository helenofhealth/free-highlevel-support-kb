## **How is using Instagram ads along with Facebook ads beneficial?**

  
Using **Instagram ads** alongside **Facebook ads** allows businesses to reach a broader, more diverse audience by leveraging the unique strengths of each platform. Instagram targets a younger, visually-driven audience, while Facebook has a broader age range. Combining both maximises visibility and engagement through different ad formats, such as Stories on Instagram and Carousel Ads on Facebook.

The cross-platform targeting enables retargeting, increasing conversion opportunities, and the unified Ad Manager makes campaign management and analytics more efficient. Overall, using both platforms enhances **audience reach**, **engagement**, and **ad performance**.

## **How to Publish ads on Instagram?**

  
On the Ad Manager home page, click on 'Create Campaign' and proceed to create a Meta Ad campaign. Below are the steps to create an ad campaign using Instagram as placement:

  
1. Select a desired Facebook page (default Facebook page will be selected and can be changed)
2. Select the Instagram account you want to use to publish ad. There will be two cases while selecting an Instagram account:  
**A:** If no Instagram account is connected to the selected Facebook page, user can select "Use Facebook page" from the Instagram account dropdown and your Instagram ad will use the name, profile picture and other details from your Facebook Page.

You'll be able to look at the metrics at the overall and individual campaign level.
