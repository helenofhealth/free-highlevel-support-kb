## **What are Carousel Ads?**

  
Carousel ads are an effective way of telling a story, highlighting different products, or showcasing various features of a single product. They engage users more actively than static ads, allowing for a more interactive experience.

  
It is a type of ad format that allows marketers to showcase multiple images or videos in a single ad unit. Users can swipe through the different cards, each of which can feature its own image, video, headline, description, and link.
