## **Introduction**

The following sections will guide you through setting up the Sales objective, answer frequently asked questions, and provide troubleshooting tips.

  
With the **Sales Objective**, businesses can run highly optimised ads using the following conversion locations:  
**Website Conversions** – Use **Meta Pixel** to track and optimise actions such as purchases and sign-ups on your website.  
**Messaging Apps** – Drive direct customer interactions via **Facebook Messenger, Instagram Direct and WhatsApp messages** to increase engagement and conversions.

## **Troubleshooting Tips**

  
**1\. My website conversions aren’t being tracked.**

* **Check Meta Pixel installation**: Ensure the Meta Pixel is installed and firing correctly on your website. You can use the **Pixel Helper** Chrome extension to verify if the Pixel is working as expected.
* **Check Pixel settings**: Make sure the Pixel is configured to track the specific conversion actions (e.g., purchase, add to cart).
* **Verify URL settings**: Ensure that the Pixel is correctly linked to the specific pages where conversions are happening.

**2\. My Messaging App isn’t tracking conversions properly.**

* **Ensure messaging is enabled**: Check that messaging apps (like Messenger, Instagram Direct or WhatsApp) are properly set up within Meta Ads and linked to your business.
* **Test interaction tracking**: Try interacting with your messaging app via an ad and verify that the conversion event is being tracked in your Meta Ads Manager.

**3\. My campaign is not delivering as expected.**

* **Adjust your budget**: If your budget is too low, it may impact the delivery of your campaign. Consider increasing it to allow the system more flexibility to optimize.
* **Check audience targeting**: Ensure that your audience settings are broad enough to generate conversions. Narrow targeting can limit delivery.
* **Review ad creatives**: Ads that are too similar or non-engaging may perform poorly. Test different creatives to see which resonates best with your audience.

**4\. How do I fix low conversion rates?**

* **Optimise your landing page**: Ensure your website or landing page is optimized for conversions with a clear call to action and fast load times.
* **Refine your audience targeting**: Analyze your audience performance and adjust it to ensure you’re targeting those most likely to convert.
* **Improve ad creatives**: Refresh your ads regularly and test new formats to keep your campaigns fresh and engaging.

## **Best Practices for Maximising Sales with Meta Ads**

* ****Use High-Quality Creatives:** Eye-catching visuals improve engagement.
* **Leverage retargeting**: Retarget website visitors or people who’ve interacted with your messaging app to bring them back to complete the conversion.
* **Optimise for mobile**: Ensure your website and messaging app are optimised for mobile users, as a significant portion of Meta Ads traffic comes from mobile devices.
* **Test and learn**: Continuously test your ad creatives, targeting options, and budgets to optimise your campaign performance.
