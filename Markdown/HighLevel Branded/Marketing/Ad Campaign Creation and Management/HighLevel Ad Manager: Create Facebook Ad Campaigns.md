Ad Manager allows you to run the ad campaigns on Facebook. Your Facebook Ads campaign is entirely in your control: design your ad content, choose a monthly budget and set a specific target audience with geography and interests. 

  
Few Prerequisite for Ad Manager -   
  
1. Selection of a pricing model from Agency view > Reselling is the first step in the Ad Manager journey. It is best to set the reselling offer of Ad Manager to sub-accounts before proceeding further.  
  
2. Toggling ON/OFF Ad Manager for a sub-account will ensure the visibility of Ad Manager tab under sub-account > marketing. It is ON by default for all the sub-accounts with 'Standard Plan' as the default pricing model.

3. Ad Manager can be enabled for the sub-account by the agency and for every user, it can be enabled from staff > permissions of Ad Manager.  
  
4. In Ad Manager, the first step is to connect your Meta Ad account, multiple Facebook pages by logging into your Facebook account via LeadConnector App. Ad Manager allows connecting multiple Facebook pages and one ad account.

### **Step 2 | Ad Content** 

  
In this step, there are three main things the focus on. The three areas are goal/objective, placement and ad content. 

  
1\. Objective - The first step to building a Facebook Ads campaign is to choose a goal that's most important for your business/brand building. Depending on the goal you choose - **Lead Generation or Website Traffic**. 

* The goal objective with Lead Generation is achieved using the Facebook form integration, the user can create their new forms or utilise the other forms. \[Learn [How to create the Facebook Form in Ad Manager](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/155000002439-how-to-create-facebook-form)\]

* The other objective of Website Traffic allows drive visitors to the landing page url.

2\. Placement - The places where you can run your ads are called placements. Automatic placements enable us to get the best results available from across all default placements based on budget allocated and help control costs. Manual placements allows user to select the places where they would like to show the ads for brand safety and optimisation.

* The user can enable the toggle to get the automatic placement, if the toggle is disabled it will allow you to choose the option of placements. ![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155026223358/original/SYhyrjcDEhGbEBVqt50G81-AC-5aojmFEg.png?1715973592)

**Multi-advertiser ads:** 

These ads in Meta are a type of advertising format that allows multiple advertisers to showcase their products or services within the same ad space. This checkbox is checked by default and can be turned off by the publisher. An explanation on how it works is mentioned below:  
  
When a potential shopper interacts with an ad, a multi-advertiser carousel may appear below it that displays products from other businesses. The products in the carousel are usually related to the ad that the user engaged with.

  
Using this can results in increased reach, cost efficiency and cross promotion amongst other benefits.

  
****Note:** Multi-advertiser ads may not be a fit for all types of campaigns, especially if there’s a need for clear brand separation or unique messaging for each business.
  
  
### **Step 3 | Budget and Audience**

In step 3, there is option to setup the monthly budget, geography and other optional settings.

1. Daily/Monthly Budget - The campaign manager can setup a daily or monthly budget for the campaign, this will work as subscription and is charged from the card associated with the connected Meta Ad account. The budget will show each day division for daily budget and the overall budget for lifetime along with the start and end date. Monthly budget can be increased or decreased by pausing and editing a campaign.  
**Note**: The currency shown will be the one that's setup in your connected Ad account and the start-end date timezone will be the timezone you're in while creating the campaign.

2. Geographic Location - Campaign can be adjusted to run for specific location or can exclude a specific location in certain country/state.

3. Optional Settings of Intended Audience can be defined to narrow down the audience - The user can add more specific setup for each option.

###   
**Step 4 | Review and Publish**

  
Once the campaign is in review stage, you can verify all the details of aesthetics, media, content, budget and other options before taking your campaign live. 

  
After the last 3 steps are completed, the Ad Campaign on clicking the publish option will charge the card added with Meta on the connected Ad account.
