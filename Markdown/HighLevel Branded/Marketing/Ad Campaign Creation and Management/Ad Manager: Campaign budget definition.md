In this article, we will be discussing about the budget definition process for an ad campaign in Ad Manager.

## **Understanding your campaign budget**

Campaign budgets for Facebook Ad campaigns are defined in the second step of the campaign setup flow. Once you enter the average amount that you want to spend on this ad campaign by selecting either daily or lifetime budget and launch your campaign, the amount specified will be charged from the card added to your connected Meta Ad account.

  
Select a budget for your Facebook Ad campaigns that aligns with your business needs. Take into account your ideal customer, the services you offer, and your vision for business or goals when determining your budget.

**Note:** The currency used by the connected Meta Ad account and timezone which is used by the sub-account will automatically be reflected for the budget definition.

Once you choose a budget and launch your campaign, it renews automatically each month. If you choose to end your ad campaign, go on to pause or delete the ad campaign.

  
**Note**: The best thing you can give a campaign is time. Let your campaign run for a few months so Ad Manager can learn about your Ads, audience and conversions. The more data, the better it can optimise and deliver results.

## **Setting daily budget**

  
When you define your daily budget, it refers to the daily average amount you wish to use to run this ad campaign. It means that on one day it could be more than defined and on other days it could be less than specified for a period of one week. The start date and time for this campaign will be the instance you publish the campaign on Ad Manager and the ad campaign is sent to Facebook for review.

Example: If you have specified your daily budget to be $1000, on one day Facebook might use $1100 as the campaign running cost and on other days of the weekly billing cycle it could be less than $1000\. 

In no way possible, the ad expense charged to you will exceed $7000\. To have a detailed understanding on how Daily Budget works in Facebook, refer:

## **Setting lifetime budget**

Lifetime budget refers to the amount user is willing to spend over the entire period of an ad campaign. It can be useful if you don't want to exceed a certain amount of overall spend, and work best if you have flexibility on how much you want to spend each day.

3. In the Budget section, have the Lifetime toggle selected and enter the amount you wish to set as your lifetime ad budget.
