## **Step 2: Choose the Facebook page and Instagram account**

1. Select the Facebook page you want your ad to associate with and reflect your business.
2. Either select an Instagram account that's connected to the selected FB page or use the Facebook page itself to showcase your ad on Instagram. Details on how to connect an Instagram account with the FB page and other important info is listed in the following [help article](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/155000004550-instagram-ads-overview).

**Note:** Instagram messaging app will not be eligible for Click to Direct ads if there is no Insta account connected to the selected page.

## **Step 3: Choose the Ad Objective**

  
1. Select **Engagement** as the objective.

2. The **Conversion Location** is defaulted to be **'** **Messaging Apps'**.
3. The **Performance goal** is defaulted to be **'Maximise number of conversations'**.  
   * This ensures Meta optimises ad delivery to encourage users to start chats with your business.

---

## **Step 4: Choose Messaging Apps for Conversations**

Under the **Messaging Apps** section, select one or more platforms where you want to receive messages:

* **Facebook Messenger**
* **Instagram Direct -** It will be active to be used only if the selected Facebook page has an Instagram account connected to it.
* **WhatsApp -** The WhatsApp can be used as a messaging app for a CTX ad only if you have WhatsApp numbers added to the Facebook page that's selected for the ad campaign.

### **What If a Messaging App is not selected?**

| Scenario                                                          | Impact                                                                                                                |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **All three apps are available (Messenger, Instagram, WhatsApp)** | The ad is shown across all platforms, and Meta algorithm decides which is the best app to reach the user.             |
| **Only Messenger and Instagram Direct are available**             | WhatsApp is not an option. Users can message you via Messenger or Instagram Direct.                                   |
| **Only WhatsApp is available**                                    | Users will be directed only to WhatsApp for conversations. The ad won't run on Messenger or Instagram.                |
| **Only one app is available**                                     | The ad campaign will be shown across all platforms but user is limited to reach you only via that messaging platform. |
| **None of the messaging apps are available**                      | The ad cannot be created under this objective. You may need to choose another objective (e.g., Traffic or Leads).     |

## **Step 7: Create Your Ad**

1. **Select an Ad Format**:

   * Keep it short and compelling.  
   * Highlight a strong **Call-to-Action (CTA)** like "Message Us Now!".
3. **Set Up the Call-to-Action (CTA)**:  
   * Choose "Send Message".  
   * If multiple messaging apps are selected, Meta will optimise the best platform to message you where you're most likely to respond.
