## **Introduction**

Affiliate marketing programs can benefit from diverse commission structures. While traditional models often focus on pay-per-sale, our platform now supports a Pay-Per-Lead (PPL) model, where affiliates earn commissions for each lead they generate. This approach is ideal for campaigns focusing on forms, surveys, and calendar bookings. Below, we’ll guide you through the process of setting up both lead tracking and PPL commissions, simplifying how you manage and reward affiliate efforts.
