### **Can an affiliate be part of multiple campaigns?**

Yes, an affiliate can be part of multiple campaigns and each campaign will provide a unique affiliate link to the affiliates. Make sure when setting up the products that you don't link the same product across multiple campaigns as this will skew your numbers.

### **My Affiliate Campaign won't publish. What can I do?**

The green color indicates that the campaign is '**Live**' and the red color indicates that the campaign is '**Paused**' (see the image above).

A campaign gets created in a paused state if

* Stripe is not connected
* Affiliates are not added

### **Where can I find my affiliate Links for each campaign?**

Each affiliate is assigned a unique referral link for every campaign they are involved in, ensuring accurate and seamless tracking of their referrals. To view these links:

1. Go to the **Affiliate** section.
2. Click on the **affiliate name**.
3. Scroll down to the **Active Referral Links** tab.

Here, youâ€™ll find a list of all the campaigns the affiliate is part of, along with their corresponding referral link URLs.

### **How can I change the domain used for the Affiliate Referral Links?**

If no branded domain is added for the account, the affiliate campaign URL will pick the default domain. Users can add their own branded domain in **Settings -> Business Profile -> Branded Domain**. Once added, the new domain will automatically reflect in all affiliate campaign URLs.

  
Here you can see the default domain being used for the URL
