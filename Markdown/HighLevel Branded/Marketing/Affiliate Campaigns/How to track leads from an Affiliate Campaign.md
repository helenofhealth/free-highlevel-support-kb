## **Step-by-Step Guide: Track Leads in Affiliate Campaigns**

### **Step 1: Navigate to the Affiliate Campaign Page**

To get started, go to the **Affiliate Manager** under the Marketing tab. From there, click on the **Campaign Page** to manage your campaigns.

  
### **Step 2: Click on Add**

Once you’re on the Campaign Page, click the **‘Add’** button to create a new campaign for lead tracking.![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155033783420/original/OJJxADubEl5Wm2ZheJMKTdXQhASzjw7X2g.jpeg?1727691963)

  
### **Step 3: Choose Sources**

Select **Forms**, **Surveys**, or **Calendars** as the source for your campaign. These sources allow you to track leads generated through your affiliate's efforts seamlessly.![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155033783421/original/HGm1Q1kW6UY5XM4U6AnVuaDetBVjsne1qg.jpeg?1727691963)

  
### **Step 4: Select Source Details**

Use the dropdown menu to specify the details of your selected source, whether it's a specific form, survey, or calendar you want to track.![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155033783419/original/xYJCHZRkvozpHlWIWkBRlcnYP18hSsC5Dg.jpeg?1727691963)

  
### **Step 5: Review Default Affiliate Campaign URL**

Take a moment to review the **default affiliate campaign URL** generated for your campaign.

_**Please Note:**_ 
If no branded domain is added to the account, the affiliate campaign URL will default to the system domain. Users can add their own **branded domain** by navigating to **Settings > Business Profile > Branded Domain**. Once the branded domain is added, all affiliate campaign URLs will automatically update.

  
### **Step 6: Enable Pay Per Lead (Optional)**

If you want to reward your affiliates for every lead they generate, enable the **Pay Per Lead** option in the Commissions tab. For more details on how to enable Pay Per Lead, [learn more here](https://help.gohighlevel.com/en/support/solutions/articles/155000003644).

  
### **Step 7: Optional Steps**

You can further customize the campaign by adding campaign descriptions, assigning affiliates, and adjusting any additional settings as needed.![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155033783417/original/ZTRR-lA0FNUA2GYiIXqj6gCJkqdx2A-T2w.jpeg?1727691962)

  
### **Step 8: Publish the Campaign**

Once you’ve reviewed and finalized all your settings, hit the **‘Publish’** button to make the campaign live.

  
### **Step 9: Track Leads**

After the campaign goes live, leads will be automatically tracked under each affiliate's profile page. Navigate to the **Leads tab** to view the leads coming from forms, surveys, or calendars. You can use the **Source field** to identify the origin of each lead.![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155033783418/original/tScA8p17VPCMhgpVjAROIzSw3l8eKJaxBw.jpeg?1727691963)

## **Important Notes for Effective Lead Tracking**

* **Custom Embed/Iframes Are Not Supported:** Lead tracking will only work if forms, surveys, or calendars are added as components inside a funnel or webpage. Ensure these components are properly integrated into the funnel before using it as a source in your affiliate campaign.
* **Branded Domain Requirement:** If you want your affiliate URLs to reflect your branded domain, you must add a branded domain in **Settings > Business Profile > Branded Domain**.
