## **How can Ad Manager be included in the SaaS plan?**

  
Inside the SaaS Configurator, agencies can select the add on products they want to offer with their SaaS plans to their customers by:

  
1. Under the Plans and Pricing tab of SaaS Configurator, we see a list of all the plans created by the agency.

3. Under the add ons tab, agency can select which reselling products they want to offer to their customers as part of this pricing plan.  
**Note:** Ad Manager add on will be OFF by default and agency can select to enable it for any pricing plan they want.

## **How does It work?**

  
Here’s how the add on products behave in a SaaS plan:

  
**Product Setup:** 

Agencies configure which reselling products they want to include in a SaaS plan.

**Purchase and Activation:** 

When someone buys the SaaS plan, the system sends a message to the reselling service with all the details of the sale and configuration.

**Subscription Creation:** 

The reselling service then creates subscriptions for each product that’s part of the SaaS bundle.

## **Important points to be noted**

  
1. Any changes in the bundle configurations will be applicable only to the sub-accounts created with respective SaaS plans in the future and do not impact the existing sub-accounts.
2. In agency billing section, locations that are subscribed to Ad Manager via SaaS plan will show as 'SaaS Bundle' instead of plan name.

3. SaaS plan subscription for sub-accounts is a monthly payment to the agency.
4. In scenarios where the sub-account cancels the SaaS plan, a prorated refund is initiated by the agency to the sub-account but the add on product subscription goes on, i.e. sub-accounts can go on to use Ad Manager even if they cancel the SaaS plan.
