# **What is Ad Manager?**

  
Ad Manager is a HighLevel feature that allows agencies to resell and manage advertising services for their sub-accounts directly within the platform. It is **not the same as Facebook Ad Manager**—instead, it serves as a centralized tool for agencies to package and monetize ad services, offering flexible pricing models and seamless subscription management. Agencies can connect their Stripe account, choose from multiple pricing plans (Standard, Utility, or Founder's Offer), and customize or waive pricing for individual clients based on their business needs.

---

## **Pre-requisites**

  
**Connect your Agency Stripe Account**

  
Your agency Stripe account will be used to collect monthly subscription payments for using Ad Manager from your clients. You can connect your agency Stripe account to your agency by following this help article - [How To Connect Stripe To Your Agency Dashboard](https://help.gohighlevel.com/en/support/solutions/articles/48001171910)

## **Choosing Your Plan**

  
You can pick your pricing plans on Agency left menu ➝ Reselling screen ➝ Core Services tab, scroll down on right side to Ad Manager section.

We have three plan for agencies to choose from:

  
**1\. Standard Plan** where HL charges a flat $10 for each sub-account that uses Ad Manager. By default the price is set as $29 which needs to be paid by the sub-account, out of which $19 goes to the agency and a static $10 goes to HL.

* Agency can change the default price from $29 to an amount of your choice. This will be the amount that sub-account has to pay in order to use Ad Manager and $10 out of it will go to HL and the remaining amount is agency's profit.

**Note:** This is the default pricing plan and will be available for all the sub-accounts even if agency has not defined any reselling amount. In other words, a sub-account can subscribe to Ad Manager by paying $29 to the agency out of which $19 is your profit and $10 goes to HL.

**2\. Utility Plan** is where a monthly subscription amount of $97 is paid by the agency to HL for unlimited campaigns in all sub-accounts or the ones you want to have Ad Manager access. Moreover, you set a flat monthly price for your sub-accounts to pay in order to use Ad Manager or choose to offer as part of your SaaS plan under SaaS configurator and that full amount will be agency's profit, i.e. no amount of money needs to be paid to HL once agency has subscribed to $97/month.

**3\. Founder's Offer** plan is where agency pays $970/year to HL for unlimited campaigns in all sub-accounts or the ones you want to have Ad Manager access. Moreover, you set a flat monthly price for your sub-accounts to pay in order to use Ad Manager or choose to offer as part of your SaaS plan under SaaS configurator and that full amount will be agency's profit, i.e. no amount of money needs to be paid to HL once agency has subscribed to $970/.

  
**Point to note**:  
1. A plan can be upgraded from standard to utility and standard to founder's but it cannot be downgraded.

## **Personalising offers for certain clients**

  
If you wish to offer a different rate to certain clients, you can do so by going to Agency left menu ➝ Sub-Accounts ➝ search for the sub-account from the list ➝ Click on the sub-account name or Manage client from the ellipses ➝ Reselling tab under the sub-account manage screen. Look for Ad manager section and set the reselling offer price or the agency markup for the location depending on what pricing plan you have opted.

When agency is on Standard plan:

**Note:** Once you have set a reselling price for a sub-account and they have subscribed to use Ad Manager at that price, you will not be able to change the price for that location. You can still make changes to the agency level reselling amount and that will be applicable to the new locations subscribing to use Ad Manager. Existing locations will be charged at the same price every month to which they subscribed at the start.

## **How to resell Ad Manager to sub-accounts for free?**

**Note:** If the agency or this sub-account is on the **standard plan**, even though you want to give Ad Manager for free to this sub-account, an amount of $10 will be charged to the agency by HL.

## **How do your clients complete the purchase?**

  
Once your clients have discovered the feature, they can proceed to purchase Ad Manager from you by clicking on the Activate Ad Manager button present under the specific Sub-Account ➝ Marketing ➝ Ad Manager tab.

When your client purchases Ad Manager it creates a subscription in the System which is between your client's card & your Stripe Account so you can collect payment from your clients.

  
When your client clicks the Pay and Subscribe button the system will create the subscription, process the payment, and take them to the Ad Manager onboarding flow.

## **How does the billing work when you upgrade the plan?**

  
When an agency opts to upgrade from Standard to Utility or Utility to Founder's Offer, an upgrade button is shown after selection of the desired upgradable plan.

  
On click of the 'Upgrade' button, a pay wall is shown to you based on the plan you choose; either $97/month or $970/year for Utility and Founder's Offer respectively. Agency need to enter your card details and that amount is paid to HighLevel. Stripe is not needed for this payment.

  
**Standard to Utility upgrade:**
