In this article, we will be discussing the steps needed to duplicate Ad campaigns from one sub-account to another using snapshots.

Using Snapshots, agency users can save time during onboarding and provide their locations with desired ad campaigns to be used as start-up templates as they begin. This allows agencies to create snapshots of their desired or high performing Ad Campaigns in one sub-account and easily load it into other existing or new sub-accounts, enabling users to have pre-configured ad campaigns seamlessly. Below enlisted are the steps which one should take to duplicate Ad campaigns from one location to another.

### **Important Notes:**

1. Ad Campaigns that are loaded to the desired sub-account will be created under the selected and connected default page of the target sub-account. Users can change it to a page of their choice.
2. All the Facebook specific assets like Lead Forms, Custom Audiences, Lookalike Audiences will not be copied as they are specific to the Ad Account and Business Manager connected at the source sub-account. Therefore, if a source sub-account ad campaign is using any of these, it will not be part of the copied ad campaigns to the target sub-account. Users would have to add the same or use the ones associate with the Ad Account they will be connecting during onboarding.
