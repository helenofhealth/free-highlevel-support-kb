Introducing better template management feature in our Template Library for Agency admins.

Problem Statement: Previously, admins navigated through multiple subaccounts to import required templates, which was time-consuming.

? 

What we did:

* Direct Create:  
Templates can now be imported/ created directly from the Admin screen.
* Streamlined Process:  
 Choose sub-accounts, preview templates, and rename them seamlessly.

‚≠ê 

Benefits:

* Efficiency:  
 Saves time by consolidating template management into one screen.
* Simplified Workflow:  
 Eliminates complexity across screens and sub-accounts.
