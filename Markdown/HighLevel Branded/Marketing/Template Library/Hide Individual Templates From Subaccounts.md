The Agency Template Library has several settings to manage the Template Libraries and Templates in Subaccounts. There is not a way to directly hide an individual Template so that only the Agency can see it, but there is a way to put individual Templates into categories which are hidden.

## **How To Hide Individual Templates**

  
1. Navigate to **Agency > Template Library.**

3. In the Template Library Admin Settings, select one of the **Products** (ex: Funnels), click **Categories > Create Category**. Give the category a clear **name** (ex: HIDDEN Funnels) and **description** (ex: Funnel templates not visible to subaccounts.), then click **Create**.

4. After the new category is created, find it in the list and click the **Hide toggle** (turns blue). There might be a modal asking you to confirm you want to hide this category for all subaccounts.

5. Return to the Agency Template Library to confirm that you can see the hidden category and the Template(s) inside it.

6. Open the relevant Product's Template Library by navigating to a subaccount > \[product\] (ex: Funnels if your hidden Category was in Funnels) > New \[product\] > from Templates. Confirm that you cannot see the hidden Category in the list of Categories visible to the subaccount. Search for the template by name to confirm it is hidden from All Templates.

7. **NOTE** that the Template(s) you want to hide from subaccounts must not be in any un-hidden Categories. Confirm that the Template's preview image has a grey box with "This template is hidden for all your sub-accounts". If the Template is hidden it will say it is hidden. If the Template is NOT hidden it will not specifically say it is visible.
