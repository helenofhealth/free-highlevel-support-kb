**We're thrilled to introduce a powerful new update to our Social Planner!**  
You can now **kickstart your posts using the Template Library**—a collection of professionally designed, ready-to-use social media templates.

And that’s not all—**Agency Owners can now add their favorite posts directly to the Template Library**, making it easier than ever to reuse top-performing content!
  
  
## **Access Control:**  
  
1. Only the **_Agency admin_** can view the admin panel and can have access to upload templates to the Template Library  
  
2\. **_Only $497 plan_** provides access to admin panel and the access to upload templates

3\. Every user would have the access to start with predefined templates in the template library  
  
**Access granted to different roles -**

| Roles          | To upload Templates  | To start with Templates |
| -------------- | -------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Agency Admin   | Yes (Only $497 Plan) | Yes                     |

## **Why do we need it?**  
Here’s why this new upload capability is essential:

* **Boost creativity**: By sharing templates, users can inspire each other with fresh ideas and unique designs.
* **Expand options**: More user-generated templates mean a wider variety of styles and formats for everyone to choose from.
* **Save time**: Accessing templates from others can help users plan and create content faster.
* **Build community**: Encourage collaboration and engagement within the user base through shared resources.
* **Stay updated**: Keep the library dynamic and relevant with continuously updated user contributions.
