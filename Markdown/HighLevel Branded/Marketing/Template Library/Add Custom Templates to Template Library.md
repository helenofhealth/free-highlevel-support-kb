## **Add a Custom Template**

  
**Step 1: Navigate to the correct Product**

The Template Library is one function but to reduce confusion the Template Library only shows items from one Product at a time. 

  
**Marketing Products**

If you want to add a **Social Planner** post as a template, navigate to Marketing > Social Planner > Content tab > CSV tab. Click on the 3-dot action menu next to the item you want to turn into a template and click Upload to social templates.

For **Email Templates**, which are also called Templates (so they're Template Templates), navigate to Marketing > Emails > Templates tab > find the one you want then click the 3-dot action menu and Upload to email templates.

**Automation Products**

If you want to add a Workflow as a template, navigate to Automation > Workflows > find the one you want and click the 3-dot action menu and select Upload to Template Library.

**Sites Products**

If you want to add a **Funnel, Website, Store, Blog, Email, Form, Survey, or Quiz** as a template, navigate to Sites > \[product\] > find the one you want and click the 3-dot action menu and select "Upload to \[product\] templates".

**Step 2: Name and Categorize the Template**

In the new modal titled "Upload to \[product\] templates" type a display name for the template and add it to a category. When you are satisfied, click Upload.

**Step 3: Edit Template in Admin Mode**

You will be taken to the admin mode to edit all of the library settings for the \[product\] template. You can edit:

1. **Name**
2. **Category**
3. **Preview**
4. **Cover image:** Upload a thumbnail or preview image to visually represent the template.
5. **Tags**: Add searchable tags that help users quickly find your template (ex: New Years).
6. **Prerequisites**: Specify requirements to use the functions in the template (ex: Stripe, email domain).
7. **Short Description**: This is a quick summary that appears in the preview card of the Template Library.
8. **Long About**: Everything else: detail use cases, content tips, or setup instructions, etc. This section supports basic formatting, so you can include feature highlights, usage instructions, or best practice tips. Think of it as a mini overview that helps users decide how and when to use the template.

**Step 4: Publish**

Once the template is ready, click Publish Template to make it public (this will make the template visible in subaccounts to be used by subaccount clients).

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

  
**Who can add or edit templates details in the Template Library?**

Only users with the Agency Admin role can add and manage templates.

  
**Is adding Custom Templates available on all plans?**

The option to add and manage custom Templates is only available on the $497/mo pro plan.

  
**If there are any updates in template added to template library, what happens?**

Changes made to the original source of the template will not flow through to the template in the Template Library.

  
**Can we hide/edit Templates already present in Template Library?**

The individual templates cannot be hidden, but Categories can be hidden, so if you add a template to only one Category, and that Category is hidden, then the Template will not appear in any Subaccount's view of the Template Library.
