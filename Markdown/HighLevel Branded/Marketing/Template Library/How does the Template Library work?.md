**Q: Can an Agency hide individual templates from Subaccounts so they are only visible to the Agency?**

Yes, but not directly. Agencies can create Categories and toggle them to Hidden. As long as a Template is in a Category that is Hidden (and not in any visible Categories) that Template will not appear for Subaccounts. See the article [Hide Individual Templates From Subaccounts](https://help.gohighlevel.com/en/support/solutions/articles/155000005571) for details.
