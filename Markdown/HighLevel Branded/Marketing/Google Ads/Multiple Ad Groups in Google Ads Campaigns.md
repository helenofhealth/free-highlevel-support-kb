# **What is Multiple Ad Groups in Google Ads Campaigns?**

  
Multiple Ad Groups in Google Ads campaigns let you structure your campaign with up to 10 separate ad groups. Each ad group targets a specific set of keywords or audience segment and can include up to 3 ads. This allows for more flexible, granular targeting and improved performance visibility — all managed directly inside HighLevel’s Ad Manager.

# **Campaign Structure Overview**

  
**Understand how campaign levels are organized and why this structure helps improve clarity and performance tracking**

  
The campaign flow is now clearly separated into 3 intuitive levels:

1. **Campaign**  
   * Set budget, bidding strategy, and target audience.
2. **Ad Group**  
   * Define keyword targeting and base URL.  
   * Manage ads within the group.
3. **Ad**  
   * Configure creative elements such as headlines, descriptions, and display path.

  
This modular approach allows better **targeting**, easier **testing**, and more actionable **insights** — especially useful for agencies managing multiple clients or complex advertising strategies.
