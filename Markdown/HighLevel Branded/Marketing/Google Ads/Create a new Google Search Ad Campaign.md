## **Prerequisites for Ad Manager**

  
Few Prerequisite for Ad Manager are as follows -   
  
1. Selection of a pricing model from Agency view > Reselling is the first step in the Ad Manager journey. It is best to set the reselling offer of Ad Manager to sub-accounts before proceeding further.  
  
2. Toggling ON/OFF Ad Manager for a sub-account will ensure the visibility of Ad Manager tab under sub-account > marketing. It is ON by default for all the sub-accounts with 'Standard Plan' as the default pricing model.

3. Ad Manager can be enabled for the sub-account by the agency and for every user, it can be enabled from staff > permissions of Ad Manager.  
  
4. In Ad Manager, the first step is to connect your Google account and associated Ad account, by logging into your Google account via LeadConnector App. Ad Manager allows connecting one google ad account.

Ad content creation is now part of a **three-level structure**:

* **Campaign Level**
* **Ad Group Level** (New)
* **Ad Level**

Each level has its own configuration process:

####   

### **A.** **Campaign Level Setup**

1. Define the **campaign name**.
2. Choose the **bid strategy** (e.g., Maximise Clicks).  
**Bid Strategy - Maximise Clicks**  
Maximum CPC bid limit is an advanced option for people who want more control over their **Maximise Clicks bid strategy**. A bid limit lets you control the maximum amount you'll pay for each click.  
    
Optional toggle to **set a max cost-per-click (CPC)** limit to control spend.  
    
![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155045734442/original/V7gvp2qxe3VYKvEuCfoWsaO94Hj4lcj4Kw.png?1745819708)  
**Note**: This bid strategy is by default added for website traffic - search campaigns, once Lead objective campaigns are introduced, other bid strategies will be included along with it.
3. Set a **daily budget:**  
The campaign manager can setup a daily budget for the campaign, this will work as subscription and is charged from the card associated with the connected Google Ad account. The budget will show each day spend division along with the start and end date. The budget amount can be increased or decreased by editing a campaign.  
**Note**: The currency shown will be the one that's setup in your connected Ad account and the start-end date timezone will be the timezone you're in while creating the campaign.
4. Configure **audience controls**:  
    
The Audience control section has two parts which are mandatory fields and are required to publish the ad campaign.  
**A:** **Geographic Location** \- Campaign can be adjusted to run for specific location or can exclude a specific location in certain country/state.  
The geographical location can be defined at both location or radius level by selecting the radio button and search - select the desired country, city, place name, address or coordinates.  
    
![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155041498506/original/JK3ncmb19RnypHhGd13QouM_W3lgOV4BgA.png?1739395256)  
**Note:**  
1\. The option to Include/Exclude a selected geographic location by Radius is not supported by Google.  
2\. When defining the geographic location by radius, the radius around the specified address can be modified to be included as the audience reach.  
**B: Language** \- Enter any language spoken by the users you want to target. Multiple languages can be searched and selected for a campaign.  
    
**Coming Soon:** The optional setting to add **retargeting** by using an existing or creating a custom audience with contact list or website visitor as the source will be available soon.  
    
**C:** **Gender and Age Targeting**  
Users can now select **gender (Male, Female, Unknown)** and **age ranges (18–24 to 65+ and Unknown)** for precise audience targeting.Tooltip support for “Unknown” selections: explains that ads will reach users without specified age/gender.

**B: Ad Group Level Setup**

* Create and name up to **10 ad groups**.
* For each ad group:  
   * Enter a **base website URL**. This URL will:  
         * Generate keyword suggestions.  
         * Be applied to all ads in the group.  
   * Add **keywords manually** or select from auto-suggestions.  
   * Define **match types**: Broad, Phrase, Exact.  
   * Enter **up to 40 positive and 40 negative keywords**.

Manage your search ad keywords from the **Ad Group** section. There are 2 sub-sections to the Keywords section namely, **Positive Keywords** and a button which turns into a section to enter '**Negative Keywords**':

* Under Keywords, enter any relevant words or phrases that will match what users might search for on Google to connect with your business:
* For each keyword, enter a word or phrase, after entering the phrase or word in the Keyword section, click enter to save that keyword or press 'Add' after selection of the keyword match type.  
   * Each keyword now has a **match type dropdown**:  
   * Broad (`keyword`)  
   * Phrase (default:`"keyword"`)  
   * Exact (`[keyword]`)
* Applies to **positive and negative keywords** (limit: 40 each, 80 characters/keyword)
* Add another phrase or word in the keyword box to create additional keywords, or click on the cross icon on the selected keyword to delete it.

**Notes**:  
1. Each word or a phrase keyword can be upto 80 characters.  
2. Upto 40 positive and negative keywords each can be added per campaign.  
3. Suggested keywords are shown based on the website entered in the ad.

Click on the '**Add Negative Keywords**' button to optionally add negative keywords.

Under Negative keywords, you can optionally add words or phrases that you do not want matched with your ad. Anyone who searches on Google with one of these negative keywords will not see your ad.

For each negative keyword, enter a word or phrase, then click Enter or 'Add' button for that keyword to be selected as a negative keyword.

Add another phrase or word in the keyword box to create additional keywords, or click on the cross icon on the selected keyword to delete it.

Each ad group can have up to **3 ads** and for each ad:

* Add **up to 15 headlines** (30-character limit each).  
   * Your ad's headline can be split into three parts, each separated by a "|" character. Under Headline 1, enter the first part of your headline.  
   * If your full headline is more than 30 characters, you can add up to 30 more characters under the Headline 2 and Headline 3 options.  
   * Use the "Add New Headline" button to dynamically add **up to 15 headlines (30 char limit each)**, defaults and mandatory: 3 headlines.
* Add **up to 4 descriptions** (90-character limit each).  
   * Under Description 1, enter a description for your ad. If your description exceeds 90 characters, you can enter an additional 90 characters under Description 2.

   * The **Display Path** fields under the Website URL section refers to the 'Path' fields that are part of your final URL. It is an **optional field** used to create a clean, user-friendly URL path on the ad. We support **two segments** (up to 15 characters each).

**Note:** All ads within a single ad group must share the same **base URL**, but may vary in display path.
  
  
Similarly, you can do the same with your Ad 2 and Ad 3 which are optional but a good addition for google to optimise your campaign better.
