## **Fallback Logic**

If no assets are added at the campaign level:

* The system will default to **account-level assets** (if available).
* If neither is present, the ad may run without these enhancements.

## **Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)**

  
1\. What happens if I upload a non-square logo?

Only **1:1 (square)** images are eligible. If a non-square image is selected, it will be **discarded silently** and not used for the ad. Use the built-in editing tool to crop images to square format.

###   

2\. Can I add multiple phone numbers as call extensions?

Yes. You can assign **multiple approved numbers**. These numbers rotate and are shown based on factors like user location, device, and availability.

###   

3\. Why is my call extension marked "Disapproved"?

Call extensions must meet Google Ads policies. Common disapproval reasons:

* Invalid or unverified number
* Country code mismatch
* Formatting issues  
Check the number's eligibility or edit and resubmit.

###   

4\. How many site links can I add?

You can add **2–20 site links**. However, we **recommend adding 4** for optimal ad delivery and visibility on Google surfaces.

###   

5\. Can I edit an existing site link or phone number?

**Yes**. Use the pencil/edit icon next to the entry in the dropdown to update it.

###   

6\. What are the benefits of campaign-level assets?

* Saves time by applying assets across all ad groups and ads.
* Maintains brand consistency.
* Ensures rich ad formats like clickable site links and call buttons are present by default.

###   

7\. Will these settings override account-level assets?

**Yes**. Campaign-level asset selections **take precedence**. If no campaign-level assets are set, then **account-level settings** will be used as fallback.
