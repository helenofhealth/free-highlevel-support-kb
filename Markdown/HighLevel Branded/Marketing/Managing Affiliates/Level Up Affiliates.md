# **Frequently Asked Questions**

**Q: Is it possible to pause level-up automation temporarily?**

There’s no native “pause” button, but you can temporarily disable level-up by switching the selected campaign in the dropdown back to “No level up campaign.” Be sure to reconfigure it manually if resuming later.

  
**Q: Can affiliates be leveled up across campaigns in different sub-accounts?**

No, the level-up process is scoped within a single sub-account. If you manage multiple sub-accounts, you’ll need to manually replicate the affiliate and campaign configuration across each account and manage transitions manually.

  
**Q: What happens if a product is removed from the source campaign after affiliates have already been leveled up?**

Removing a product from the original campaign won’t impact already leveled-up affiliates, but it will stop future tracking of commissions for that product in the original campaign. If the product also exists in the destination campaign, future purchases will be tracked there based on the level-up rule and customer handling option you chose.

  
**Q: Can I use tags, contact attributes, or affiliate-specific filters to control who qualifies for a level-up?**

Currently, level-up is only triggered by quantitative performance (Customers or Revenue). Filters based on tags, attributes, or manual qualification logic are not supported, but you can use workflows to assign tags post-level-up as part of a broader automation strategy.
