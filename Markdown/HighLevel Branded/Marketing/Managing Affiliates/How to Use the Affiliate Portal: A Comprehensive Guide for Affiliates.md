## **What is the Affiliate Portal?**

The Affiliate Portal is a centralized platform where affiliates can manage various aspects of their affiliate marketing efforts. It provides access to performance statistics, commission information, customer data, and more. By logging into the portal, affiliates can track their leads, payments, and campaign success, all while easily accessing their referral links and important affiliate program details.

## **How to Get Started with the Affiliate Portal**

### **Step 1: Adding Affiliates to a Campaign**

Once an affiliate is added to an active campaign, they will receive an invitation email to access the Affiliate Portal. Ensure that the "Invite Email" option is toggled on in the campaign settings.

You can also automate welcome emails or SMS messages with details on how affiliates can get started. Learn more \[here\].  
  
### **Step 2: Affiliate Login**

Affiliates can log in using the credentials provided in their invitation email. Once inside, they will be directed to the **Affiliate Dashboard** where they can view their campaign data and affiliate links.
