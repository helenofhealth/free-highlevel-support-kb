Sub-affiliates are affiliates who work under a parent affiliate. They promote products or services through their own networks, and the parent affiliate earns a commission from the sales made by their sub-affiliates. This model helps affiliates expand their networks and increase their earnings.

  
Our platform supports up to 7-tier affiliate campaigns, allowing affiliates to have multiple sub-affiliates under them.

**Please Note:** 
The campaign you want to add sub-affiliates to must be multi-tier (tier 2 or above).

## **Benefits of Sub-Affiliates**
