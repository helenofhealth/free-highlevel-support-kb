## **Key Features and Use Cases**

With Affiliate-Level Commission Settings, you can:

* **Set Custom Commission Rates**: Override the default campaign commission for individual affiliates.
* **Manage Tiered Commissions**: Adjust commission rates for multi-tiered campaigns.
* **Reward High Performers**: Offer higher commissions to top-performing affiliates without affecting the rest of the campaign.

## **Example Use Case:**

Letâ€™s say your default campaign offers a **40% commission** to all affiliates. However, you have an affiliate who consistently drives **high-value sales**, and you want to offer them a higher rate. Using this feature, you can easily set a **50% commission** for that affiliate without changing the overall campaign settings, allowing you to reward their exceptional performance.
