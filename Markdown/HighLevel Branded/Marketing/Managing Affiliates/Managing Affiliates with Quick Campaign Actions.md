**IMPORTANT**: The two options are: 
  
**1. Keep them in the old campaign:** Existing customers and their recurring commissions will stay under the current campaign.  
**2. Move them to the new campaign:** Future commissions from existing customers will now follow the new campaign’s rules.
  
  
### **Step 4:** Choose whether to send the welcome email

  
If the target campaign has welcome emails disabled, no email will be sent even if this is turned on. If the campaign has welcome emails enabled, you can disable it here to skip sending for this affiliate. Once you’ve made your selections, click Move Affiliate to complete the action.
