**What is a dynamic timer?** 

A **Dynamic Countdown Timer** is a personalized countdown that adjusts based on each contact's interaction with your email. Unlike static timers that show the same countdown for all recipients, a dynamic timer starts counting down from the moment a contact **opens** or **receives** the email, making it unique for each person.

For example:  
1\. If the duration is set to 2hours and trigger is "Email Opened" for a case with no end time - 

* **Contact A** opens the email at 2 PM, and their timer counts down from 2 PM to 4 PM.
* **Contact B** opens the email at 5 PM, and their timer counts down from 5 PM to 7 PM.

2\. If the duration is set to 2hours and trigger is "Email Opened" for a case with end time as 12AM - 

* **Contact A** opens the email at 2 PM, and their timer counts down from 2 PM to 12AM
* **Contact B** opens the email at 5 PM, and their timer counts down from 5 PM to 12AM.

This feature allows you to set personalized, time-sensitive experiences for each recipient, increasing engagement and driving immediate action based on their specific interaction with your campaign.

## **What is "Countdown Timer Ends at Time"?**

The **"Countdown Timer Ends at Time"** feature ensures that the timer **ends at a fixed, specific time**, rather than ending after a set duration from when the email is opened. This creates a more **authentic** and **realistic** time-sensitive experience for your contacts.

### **Why is it Useful?**

The **"Ends at Time"** setting is important because it avoids situations where the timer seems unrealistic or like a marketing gimmick. For example:

* **Scenario**: If a user opens an email at **11:07 PM** with a 2-hour duration, the timer would normally end at **1:07 AM**. However, this could feel like an **unrealistic extension** just for that contact, as the offer may seem tailored only for them.
* **With "Ends at Time"**: Instead, you can set the timer to **end at a specific time**, like **12 AM**, making the timer consistent and **authentic** for all recipients, regardless of when they open the email. This ensures the urgency feels **real** and not artificially manipulated for each individual.

In short, **"Ends at Time"** helps keep the timer aligned with real-world timeframes, providing a more genuine, believable experience.

  
## **Benefits**

* **Personalization**: Unique timers for each contact.
* **Urgency**: Drives immediate action with time-sensitive offers.
* **Flexibility**: Set custom durations and triggers.
