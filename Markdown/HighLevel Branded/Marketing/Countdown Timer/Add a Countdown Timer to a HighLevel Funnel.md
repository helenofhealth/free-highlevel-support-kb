# **What is a Countdown Timer?**

  
Countdown timers visually track the remaining time until a specific event or deadline. In HighLevel, these timers can be reused across sites, styled to match your brand, and configured to behave in different ways depending on your goals. You can use them to drive urgency during launches, offer expiration notices, or event registrations.
