The latest update to the **Dynamic Timer** feature allows users to set a timer that ends after a specific duration from when an email is **opened or sent**. Previously, end times were restricted by the timer’s duration, but now users have greater flexibility in configuring countdown timers.

  
# **Key Benefits of the Optional End Time Feature**

This enhancement provides more control over countdown timers, improving the user experience and campaign effectiveness.

* **Greater Flexibility** – The timer now ends after the chosen duration, rather than being tied to a specific time.
* **Improved Customization** – Marketers can create personalized countdown timers based on recipient engagement.
* **Enhanced Campaign Performance** – Encourages timely user action by creating urgency based on email interactions.

## **Example Use Cases**

* **Limited-Time Offers** – A **2-hour discount** activated from an abandoned cart email.
* **Birthday Promotions** – A **24-hour special offer** triggered when the recipient opens their birthday email.
* **Flash Sales** – A countdown that starts only when the email is read, ensuring a dynamic and engaging experience.
