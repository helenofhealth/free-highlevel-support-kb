## **Frequently Asked Questions**

  
**Q: Why are timers inaccurate in Apple Mail?**  
Apple Mail caches content to protect privacy, so timers freeze at delivery time rather than updating live.  
  
**Q: What happens if I don’t enable this feature?**  
Apple Mail users will see outdated timers, reducing urgency and potentially harming trust.

  
**Q: Do timers still redirect after expiry even if hidden?**  
Yes, as long as you're using a dynamic link in a button, expiry redirection still works.  
  
**Q: Will other email clients still display the timer?**  
Yes, this setting only affects Apple Mail clients.

  
**Q: Can I enable this for an existing timer?**  
Absolutely. Edit the timer, check the box in the Styling tab, and save.
