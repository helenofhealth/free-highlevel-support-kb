Editing a countdown timer is essential when you want to update its appearance, change its timing details, modify linked actions, or adjust its name. Here's a step-by-step guide on when and how to edit a countdown timer.

###   
**When Can You Edit a Countdown Timer?**

You can make changes to the countdown timer **only before** it has been used in an email campaign. Once the countdown timer has been included in an email that has been sent out, the only option left is to **archive** the timer. So, ensure all changes are made **before** sending any email that includes the timer.

###   
**What Can You Edit?**

1. **Style Changes:**  
   * You can change the appearance of the timer by adjusting the font, colors, and overall design to match your branding.
2. **Timer Details:**  
   * This includes modifying the time remaining, the end date, or any other time-related details to align with your campaign goals.
3. **Dynamic Link Changes:**  
   * You can update the dynamic link associated with the timer, which may redirect users to a different landing page or resource once the timer ends.
4. **Naming:**  
   * Adjust the name of the timer to keep things organized or to better reflect the purpose of the countdown.
