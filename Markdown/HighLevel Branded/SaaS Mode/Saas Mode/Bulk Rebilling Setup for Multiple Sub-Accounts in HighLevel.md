# **What is Bulk Rebilling Markup Configuration?**

  
The Bulk Rebilling Markup Configuration feature allows agencies to set rebilling markups across multiple sub-accounts at the same time. Previously, agencies had to configure each account individually, which was time-consuming and prone to errors. Now, you can apply standardized markup logic to dozens or even hundreds of sub-accounts instantly, making it easier to monetize services consistently and efficiently.

## **Key Benefits of Bulk Rebilling Markup Configuration**

  
Applying markups in bulk streamlines your billing operations and enforces uniform pricing policies across your client base.

  
* **Time Efficiency**: Eliminate repetitive per-account edits and reclaim hours each month
* **Revenue Consistency**: Apply identical markup logic to every client, ensuring predictable and consistent margins
* **Operational Scalability**: Roll out new services or price changes to hundreds of accounts in at once
* **Error Reduction**: Centralized settings decrease the risk of mismatched or forgotten markups
* **Onboarding Speed**: Pair bulk rebilling with automated SaaS onboarding to get new clients live faster

## **Bulk Action History**

  
Every bulk job is logged in **Bulk Action History**. Here you can track status, drill into past actions and (when supported) roll back or re‑run the action. This audit trail helps your team verify changes and troubleshoot edge cases without guessing which accounts were updated. To access to **Bulk Action History**, click the **Clock Icon** located next to **Bulk Actions** on the **Sub-Accounts** page.

#### **Step 1:** Select Sub-Accounts

#### **Step 3:** Choose Payment Provider

  
* In the pop‑up, select your connected payment provider, such as Stripe,and click **Continue**

#### **Step 4:** Configure Markups

  
* The **Configure Rebilling Services** modal lists each usage‑based service (Phone, Email, AI, etc.)

* Click the **Arrow** icon next to each service to view the rate breakdown

#### **Step 6:** Verify Rebilling Activation

  
* If a sub-account already has a card on file, rebilling will activate immediately with the new markup settings
* If a sub-account does not yet have a payment method, a customer profile will be created with your selected payment provider. Once the sub-account admin adds a card, rebilling will automatically activate using the predefined markups.

## **Important Notes and Best Practices**

  
Understanding these operational details will help you avoid potential issues and maximize the efficiency of this feature.

  
* Sub-accounts without a payment method **will not start rebilling** until a card is added, but your markup configurations will be saved and ready.
* Double-check markup percentages to align with your agency’s overall pricing and profitability goals.
* Audit your markup configurations periodically to ensure all sub-accounts stay consistent with your current policies.
* Consider creating internal SOPs to pair this feature with standardized onboarding flows for new sub-accounts.
