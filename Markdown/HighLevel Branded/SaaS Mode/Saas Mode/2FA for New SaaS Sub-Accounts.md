## Use Case

Protecting SaaS agencies from scammers who use VoIP numbers and disposable email IDs to create multiple sub-accounts.

  
## How it works?

1. Agencies can enable 2FA for newly signing-up SaaS sub-accounts from **_SaaS Configurator > Advanced Settings > 2-Factor Authentication_**.

2. When the clients tries to purchase a phone number for the first time, the sub-account admin is asked to enter an SMS enabled phone number which will then get a verification code that they have to enter.![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155013478151/original/nIRphKVFHbJ9TUBBTVMuJjz_UOOtLlfuOg.png?1700759362)
3. They can proceed to purchase phone numbers after the 2FA is successfully completed.

  
A phone number can NOT be used to create/verify another sub-account till 7 days after it has been used to verify a sub-account.

  
## Bypassing 2-Factor Authentication

1. There is no way for a sub-account admin to bypass the 2FA.
2. Agency admins will have the option to manually verify a sub-account (without any code) from the sub-account's Manage Client page.
