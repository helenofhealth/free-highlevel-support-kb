SaaS mode now allows you to restrict the number of contacts that can be created in a sub-accounts.

  
The contact limit is NOT A COMPLETE LIMIT, i.e. more contacts can still be created in the sub-account via APIs, Forms, Workflows etc. even after the limit has been exhausted. That said, users won't be able to create more contacts from the UI, i.e. manually creating contacts or importing contacts in bulk.

### **Step 3:** Set/update the desired limit and select ‘Save’.

  
The contact limit that is set on the 'Manage Client' page overrides the limit of the subscribed plan for that sub-account. **If the sub-account upgrades their plan, then the limit will also be reset according to their new plan**.
