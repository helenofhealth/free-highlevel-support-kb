## **Resell WhatsApp with Wallet Balance**

  
**Allowing wallet-based purchases removes payment provider limitations and increases customer accessibility.**

  
When wallet reselling is enabled, customers are given the option to pay using their wallet funds. If the wallet balance is insufficient, the system automatically prompts them to recharge, ensuring a smooth purchase journey without needing to exit the flow.

  
## **Seamless Wallet Integration**

  
**The wallet service now directly integrates with the paywall, delivering a frictionless checkout experience.**

  
The system automatically verifies the wallet balance before confirming a subscription purchase. If the balance is too low, customers can instantly recharge without restarting their purchase flow, leading to higher conversion rates and fewer abandoned transactions.

## **Unified Subscription Management**

  
**Manage all your WhatsApp subscriptions, regardless of payment method, from one centralized dashboard.**

  
Stripe and wallet-based subscriptions are now viewable in a single place, providing a simplified, consolidated view of all reselling activities. This eliminates the need to switch between multiple management screens.

  
## **Real-Time Transaction Updates**

  
**Stay fully informed with real-time webhook support for wallet subscription events.**

  
Webhook events notify you of important subscription changes, including:

* Wallet recharge initiated
* Subscription purchase successful
* Subscription renewal using wallet
* Recharge failure alerts

  
This ensures you are always aware of your customers’ transaction statuses without having to manually check dashboards.
