SaaS Mode now supports Stripe, NMI, [Authorize.net](//Authorize.net) and Square for processing payments for subscriptions. The system uses the Payments module inside your **'Agency Sub-Account'** to manage customers and subscriptions, which in turn is connected to your payment provider to process payments.

  
> **'Agency Sub-Account'** is the sub-account that is owned by you (the Agency), which is used for managing your internal operations. None of your customers ideally should have access to this sub-account.  
>  
> It is recommended to create a fresh new sub-account for managing SaaS Mode. You can also have multiple of such sub-accounts.
