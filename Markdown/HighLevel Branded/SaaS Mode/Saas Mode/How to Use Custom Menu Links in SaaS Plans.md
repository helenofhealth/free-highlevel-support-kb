# **What Are Custom Menu Links?**

  
Custom Menu Links (CMLs) allow agencies to embed 3rd-party solutions, such as AI tools, inventory management systems, or virtual assistant tools, directly into the HighLevel app. By linking these tools through iframes, agencies can offer an integrated experience to their users.

## **Benefits Of Custom Menu Links**

  
Many SaaS businesses offer additional solutions alongside HighLevel features as part of their service package. With this functionality, Custom Menu Links can now be tied directly to SaaS plans. When a new sub-account subscribes to a plan, the associated Custom Menu Links are automatically applied without requiring manual setup.

  
* **Auto Deployment**: Automating CML setup for new sub-accounts eliminates manual configuration.
* **Enhanced User Experience**: Embedded solutions feel like a native part of the HighLevel app.
* **Consistency**: Ensures that all sub-accounts subscribing to a plan receive the same setup.
* **Plan-Level Configuration**: Add CMLs directly to SaaS plans, ensuring all new sub-accounts inherit the links.
* **Easy Updates**: Add or modify CMLs in existing SaaS plans, and changes will apply to all future sub-accounts that subscribe to the plan.
* **Scalability**: Simplifies onboarding as your SaaS offering grows.

## **Create Custom Menu Links**

  
Navigate to **Agency Account > Settings > Custom Menu Links** \> Create New or Edit. Fill out the settings. In the URL field you can use **Custom Values**, for example: http://url.com/{{location.id}}?value={{custom\_values.my\_value}}. These {{string}} are called Merge Fields and a full list is here: [List of Merge Fields](https://help.gohighlevel.com/en/support/solutions/articles/48001078171).

## **Getting the user's context within the Custom Menu Link**

  
While creating the Custom Menu Link, you can set the URL like this:

https://test.com/test?fname={{user.first\_name}}&lname={{user.last\_name}}&location\_id={{location.id}}&custom\_value\_example={{custom\_values.example\_field\_name}}

  
This way, when a user clicks on the link, HighLevel will dynamically replace the param variables with actual values based on the user's context. You can extract these params from the URL and get the user's context.

  
**Supported params to CML**

user.first\_name

user.last\_name

user.name

user.phone

user.email

location.id

location.name

location.city

location.state

location.country

location.address

location.email

location.phone

location.postal\_code

location.full\_address

location.website

location.logo\_url

location\_owner.first\_name

location\_owner.last\_name

location\_owner.email

custom\_values.{CUSTOM\_VALUE\_NAME}
