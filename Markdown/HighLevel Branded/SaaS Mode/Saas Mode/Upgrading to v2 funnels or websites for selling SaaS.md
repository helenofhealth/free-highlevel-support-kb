# Why do I need to move to v2 funnels if I am selling SaaS?

You need to upgrade your existing funnels & websites that you use to sell SaaS to v2 versions because of enhanced security and card authorization capabilities that are built into v2 funnels. This will provide you a more robust and secure subscription management experience for your SaaS initiative. 

  
v2 funnels & websites 

* allow you to create one-step order checkouts
* are compatible with 3D secure payments
* are faster
* use Stripe connect integration instead of API key integration
* work better with products, prices & payments features
* have built -in card authorization security when you sell a recurring product

  
v2 funnels & websites are better than v1 funnels & websites in all aspects.

  
In this article we will discuss how you can migrate to v2 funnels & websites if you are currently selling SaaS using an old funnel.
