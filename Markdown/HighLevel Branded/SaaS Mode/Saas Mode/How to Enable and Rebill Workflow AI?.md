## **How does re-billing work?**

* Agencies pay HighLevel and get invoices with high-level branding
* Sub-accounts (your clients) pay you (the agency) and get invoices with your branding. The money is deposited in your Stripe account connected to your agency level. [How do I connect my agency's Stripe account to collect client payments?](https://help.gohighlevel.com/en/support/solutions/articles/48001171910)

  
This is very similar to other products that use re-billing or reselling models in the platform. Just like LC Phone or LC Email re-billing, re-billing of the Premium Workflow actions also utilizes "credits" from the agency wallet & the location wallet, respectively.
