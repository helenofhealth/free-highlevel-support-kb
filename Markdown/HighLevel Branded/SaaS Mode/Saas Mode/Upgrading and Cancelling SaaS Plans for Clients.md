## **How to change the SaaS plan from your end?**

In this example, we have 3 SaaS plans, Standard, Professional, and Premium. Each higher plan has more features offered.

[![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155020258949/original/iwQXM_JzjMLirjDw2kQ1AidyiF2v7PQZKA.jpeg?1707729959)](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/48179188952/original/xg82nBBNc8zEEx0Q6jvtLt240q4mCO6EIg.png?1642180292)

  
We have a location on the Standard plan with basic features only.

[![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155020258960/original/jcAMEoUwIm_uE7wXubwCktB2PyIVZuzSQg.jpeg?1707729961)](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/48179189995/original/MTfPSGTUV%5FDzOktBCvriVc4ymTDBR-Oc6Q.png?1642180555)

  
To upgrade this location to the Professional plan, we will need to go into our Stripe account and open the customer associated with this location.

###   
**Finding the Stripe Customer**

You can search the customer in Stripe using your client's email. However, the preferred method is to search for the invoice ID for this location and get the customer ID from there.

  
1. **Step-1:** Go into Subaccount Settings > Company Billing and click "View" for any invoice shown in the Billing History[![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155020258956/original/EPSCcb5ZUT7GqwvgfPowwHQOMEv2BsLJ-A.jpeg?1707729960)](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/48179191623/original/YgHpXmm6kMJ-ZXFtH%5FampYMSw6Qq10CdJQ.png?1642180932)
2. **Step-2:** Copy the invoice number[![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155020258944/original/mhLy-P2DUHn-SHsR-U9Q6kkpkD2JWYiLpQ.png?1707729958)](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/48179191948/original/28%5FJ0a%5FIQe8l30wGT2UWHt0iDyTkxAwCqQ.png?1642181036)
3. **Step-3:** Search for the invoice number on Stripe and click on the invoice to open the details[![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155020258941/original/asbvNH1s6FCXoCyiuvobSjzsEMfbQkwmew.png?1707729957)](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/48179192675/original/IxhpfGaIOK5uxgGt3WgUba37jlPIW6ybQg.png?1642181198)
4. **Step-4:** Click on the customer email shown in the 'Billed to' column on the invoice; it will take you to the customer's profile in Stripe[![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155020258953/original/AvrjpUC2uADy1Fpu6yEsYgaGFsWdNyHdSg.jpeg?1707729960)](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/48179193172/original/jJl6AoSWYy6CzP-DRhLJOuy9aCe%5FS1tF0Q.png?1642181316)

  
### **Changing the subscription plan**

Now that we are in the customer profile on Stripe, we have updated the client's subscription plan.

4. **Step-4:** On your agency account, go to the Accounts tab > View details for the location. The plan is now upgraded, **BUT** you still need to update their accessible features according to the new plan:[![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155020258952/original/ymQXeiYsIvqfkWEGhykJEAoE077TnOhVCw.jpeg?1707729960)](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/48179200049/original/j2uNrKdUuGRToQ7uQSxL%5FinhtBd%5FCYkXlw.png?1642183048)

## **How to allow the client to cancel their subscription?**

SaaS agencies can now allow their SaaS clients to cancel their subscriptions. **This feature is turned off by default because we believe taking cancellation requests and getting an opportunity to save the SaaS client is essential in churn-aversion.** But regardless, the decision rests with you now! Agencies can enable this feature by going to their SaaS configurator. 

  
![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155020262546/original/db5vTaQnSCztWGzwgftQla8J0JKdgAaohA.png?1707731252)

_This will apply this setting to all SAAS accounts that will be created using your SAAS configurator moving forward._

3. **Step-3:** Once you mark the checkbox to **Allow client (sub-account) to cancel their subscription**, your clients will be able to cancel their Subscription. This setting will only apply to this sub-account and not all SAAS accounts created using your SAAS configurator moving forward.  
Once this checkbox is marked, your client will see a Modify Subscription button below their subscription details in **Settings > Company Billing:**![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155020262538/original/M1ZNUwtQ414WLcr1VVOQbZE4O8pT3y98yg.png?1707731250)
4. **Step-4:** Upon clicking **Cancel,** your client will see the following confirmation popup:

7. **Step-7:** Your clients can reactivate their sub-accounts by clicking the reactivate button if they cancel their subscriptions. Also, they will have the option to change payment methods if required.

## **How to cancel SaaS-enabled sub-account yourself?**

####   

### [**Step 1: Reconcile SaaS Wallet Balance**](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/48001207115-saas-wallet-credit-management#How-to-Remove-Credits-from-the-wallet?)

If the client has any non-complimentary credits in their wallet, you must refund those in Stripe.

You can check if the wallet credits are complimentary or non-complimentary by going to **Sub-Account Settings > Company Billing > See Details (Transaction History)**

  
For more details, please check the article: [SaaS Wallet Credit Management ](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/48001207115-saas-wallet-credit-management)

  
![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155020264621/original/jYOdXoLAyBiFnnHpBNOXlsTFTglFu8lFaQ.png?1707732186)  
  
### **Step 2: Disable SaaS on the Sub-Account from Agency View**

[](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/48001204857-ways-to-get-highlevel-support-24-7)Disable SaaS for this sub-account by going to **Agency View > Accounts Tab > View Details**

Cancel the Stripe subscription if you no longer want to charge the client for the SaaS plan:

  
![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155020264619/original/GpCqMF1Iw0B45BVsJ93zHa0BHYlfbbactg.png?1707732186)

  
We recommend exporting all transaction details before disabling SaaS, because once SaaS mode is disabled, all transaction/wallet history will be removed.

  
![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155020264622/original/5KtpVkT2x-TeSt0Zjyr8ZNavJu_iZglX3w.jpeg?1707732186)
  
  
### **Step 3: Close Twilio / Mailgun Sub-Accounts - For Clients who're leaving your Agency**

If the sub-account has Twilio or Email (Mailgun), Rebilling is turned on after disabling SaaS; their Twilio / Mailgun sub-account will still be connected in **Agency Settings > Twilio / Mailgun**. Make sure you've deleted those connections and closed these sub-accounts.  
  
  
**Step 4: Remove User from Team Management / Delete the Sub-Account - For Clients who're leaving your Agency**

This step depends on your choice.

1. If you want to keep the client's data even after removing them, go to Agency Settings > Team and remove the client's user.
2. If you don't want to keep their data, go to Accounts > View Details, and delete the sub-account
