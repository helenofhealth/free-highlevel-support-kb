* **Note Icon (with note count)**
* **Tags Icon (with tag count)**
* **Call Icon**
* **Appointment Icon (with next appointment date)**

**When you export opportunities from the customized view, the export will include all fields of the opportunity, not just the ones visible on the card** 

## **Feature 2 - Customizing for Multiple Pipelines**

**![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155034966728/original/Nk84MSDUQqHusKTwnH7Od5stwyK8Hq6YEA.png?1729252697)**

* **Customizations are applied per pipeline by default. However, if there are multiple pipelines in your location, you have an additional option to apply the changes to all pipelines.**
* **Customizations are user-specific, meaning the changes will only apply to the user making the modifications, allowing personalized views.**

**Customizations you make are sticky to the current view, meaning they will persist until you choose to modify them again. However, the customizations only persist for the user on their current local storage and will not be reflected if you launch the same in a different browser or for a different user.**

## **Feature 3 - Layout Options**

* **Default View:**
