# **Custom Fields Questions**

  
### **Q: How can I see my custom fields in an Opportunity?**

### **Q: What does the 'hide empty fields' feature do?**

  
When enabled, the 'hide empty fields' feature hides all fields with no value. This allows you to focus only on fields that are relevant or required for you, providing a cleaner, more streamlined view of your opportunity data.
