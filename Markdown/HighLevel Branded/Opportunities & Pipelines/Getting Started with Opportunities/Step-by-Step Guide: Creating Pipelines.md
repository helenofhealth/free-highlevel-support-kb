Pipeline names always need to be unique and adding or updating another pipeline with an identical name is not allowed.

  
### **Step 3: Adding Stages to Your Pipeline**

* With your new pipeline created, you'll see an empty canvas where you can add stages.
* Enter the name of the first stage of your pipeline
* Click on the "Add Stage" button to create more stages
* Repeat this process to add additional stages, defining the sequential flow of your pipeline.
* You can also reorder the different pipeline stages using the up and down arrows on the left of the stage name.
* Note that you need not create stages for "Won" or "Lost". HighLevel creates those stages for every pipeline of yours by default.![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155020386785/original/EUtEKMZ5FLB5RzKla48Fhf463Qdkf7Uqmw.png?1707823816)

Stage names always need to be unique and adding or updating another stage with an identical name is not allowed.

  
### **Step 4: Pipeline Actions and Dashboard configuration**

* ###  
The funnel and pie chart options allow you to decide whether the pipeline should be shown in the dashboard or not
* You can also configure whether or not to show each stage in the dashboard funnel and pie charts by clicking on their icons at the right of the respective stage.
