# **What is Adding a Custom Form to Calendars**

  
Custom forms in HighLevel allow you to gather personalized information from contacts before they book an appointment. When you connect a form to a calendar, users must complete the form after selecting a time slot. This ensures you collect vital data that gets saved directly to the contact’s CRM record, enabling personalized and efficient follow-ups.

  
In order to add custom forms to your calendars, you will first need to have created a form in your sub-account. [Click here to learn how to create custom forms.](https://help.gohighlevel.com/en/support/solutions/articles/155000003223)

## **How to Add the Same Form in Multiple Calendars**

  
If your business offers several appointment types or team member calendars, reusing one consistent form can save time and maintain uniform data collection. This is helpful when you need the same intake or qualification data across services or departments.

  
* After creating the form under **Sites > Forms**, you can assign it to multiple calendars.
* Simply repeat the same process for each calendar you would like to assign the form to:  
    
   1. Navigate to **Calendar Settings**  
   2. Click the **Edit** button  
   3. Then choose the form from the **Select Form** dropdown.

  
**Custom Forms Must Be Added Individually Per Calendar**  
  
Adding a form to a calendar is a manual process, forms are not auto-applied across calendars. Even if you're using the same form across multiple calendars, you need to add it to each calendar’s settings separately. This gives you control over which form appears on which booking flow.

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

  
**Q: Can I use more than one custom form on a single calendar?**  
No. Only one custom form can be attached to a calendar at a time.

  
**Q: What happens to the data submitted in the form?**  
Form responses are automatically saved to the contact’s record in your CRM, as long as the form fields are mapped to custom fields.

  
**Q: Can I use the same form on multiple calendars?**  
Yes. A single form can be assigned to multiple calendars by selecting it in each calendar's settings.

  
**Q: Why isn’t my form showing up in the calendar dropdown?**  
Make sure your form is saved under **Sites > Forms** and contains at least one field. You may need to refresh the calendar settings page after saving.

  
**Q: Does the form appear before or after selecting a time slot?**  
The form appears after a time slot is selected. Users choose a time first, then complete the custom form to confirm the booking.

  
**Q: Can I edit the form after attaching it to the calendar?**  
Yes. Any changes to the form will automatically reflect in calendars it’s attached to. However, be careful not to delete critical fields tied to automations or records.
