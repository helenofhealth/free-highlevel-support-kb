## **Frequently Asked Questions**

  
**Q: How do I stop the automatic confirmation email with a meeting link from being sent before I approve the appointment?**

When using manual confirmation in calendars, the system may still send a default confirmation email as soon as the appointment is bookedâ€”even before you approve it.

  
To stop this, go to **Calendars > Edit Calendar**, then open "**Confirmation Settings"**. Enable the **Custom Confirmation Email** toggle to write your own message, or leave it disabled to prevent any automatic confirmation email. This allows you to fully control confirmations through workflows after manually approving the appointment.
