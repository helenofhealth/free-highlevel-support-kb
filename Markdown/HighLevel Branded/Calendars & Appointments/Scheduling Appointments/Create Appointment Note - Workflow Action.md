## Overview

We have introduced a new action under the **Appointments** category called **Create Appointment Note**. This action allows you to add notes to an appointment through a workflow.

---

## Inputs

* **appointmentId** (string) – Required when using inbound webhook trigger.
* **body** (string, max length: 5000 characters) – The content of the appointment note.

---

## How It Works

* If you are using any **appointment-based trigger** (e.g., Appointment Status, Customer Booked Appointment), **the appointment ID is not required**. The note will be added to the appointment enrolled in the workflow.

* If you are using an **Inbound Webhook trigger**, you must **pass the appointment ID** to ensure the note is added to the correct appointment.

#### If using an **Appointment-based trigger** (Appointment Status or Customer Booked Appointment):

* **Appointment ID is not required**.
* **Note Body:** You can manually enter a custom note of your choice.

## Important Considerations

* If using **Inbound Webhooks**, ensure that the webhook payload includes both **appointmentId** and **body** for seamless functionality.
* The **body field** has a maximum limit of **5000 characters**.

  
This feature allows businesses to efficiently log appointment-related notes directly through workflow automation, reducing manual effort and improving organization.
