## **Booking Appointments Manually**

  
HighLevel makes it easy for users to book appointments manually across different areas of the platform. Booking Calendar Appointments as a User (Manually) is helpful when you want to create appointments on behalf of a contact, especially when working across different time zones or calendars. Whether you're communicating with a contact, managing calendars, or accessing a specific contact profile, there are multiple ways to schedule appointments in just a few clicks. Manual booking ensures you're always in control of scheduling, even when contacts are offline, unresponsive, or need extra assistance.

## **Key Benefits of Manually Booking Appointments**

  
Manual booking gives you the flexibility to schedule appointments directly from within the platform without needing the customer to take action. This is especially useful in high-touch workflows, urgent situations, or internal coordination. Here’s how it helps:

  
* **Schedule appointments on behalf of leads or customers** when they can't or don’t take action themselves.
* **Book appointments while on a call** to secure a slot instantly
* **Respond to SMS or email confirmations** by locking in an appointment from your end
* **Book internal meetings with team members** directly within the system
* **Create test appointments** to QA workflows, reminders, or calendar logic
* **Choose specific dates, times, and calendars** when precision matters
* **Work across multiple time zones** with automatic timezone detection
* **Add recurring events and block off time** to manage availability effectively

## **Different Ways to Access the "Book Appointment" Feature**

  
You can start booking an appointment from four different entry points within the HighLevel platform. There are four different ways to access the **Book Appointment Feature** in HighLevel, such as from a contact profile, the conversations tab, or the calendar view. Choose the method that suits your workflow best.
  
  
**IMPORTANT**:  All of these access points lead to the _same_ booking interface and functionality. No matter which path you take, you'll arrive at the exact same feature with the same options and settings. This flexibility is designed for user convenience, hence choose the route that best fits your workflow.

## **Booking the Appointment (After Accessing the Modal)**

  
Once you've accessed the **Book Appointment** modal using any of the four available methods, the booking steps are the same. This section walks you through choosing a calendar, selecting a contact, adding details, and finalizing the appointment.

###   

### **Step 1:** Select the Calendar & Contact

  
Select which calendar you want the appointment to be created in and the contact it should be assigned to.

### **Step 2:** Add Appointment Details

  
In this step, you'll enter the key information that defines your appointment — including title, time, location, and recurrence options. HighLevel helps streamline this by automatically detecting time zones and providing flexible input options for custom bookings.

  
* **Appointment Title**: Add a relevant subject (e.g., “Consultation with Sarah”). You could also add a description of the title below.
* **Date & Time**: Choose a start and end time. The system will display the user's time zone but can be toggled with custom Date and Time.
* **Custom:**  
   1. You'll be prompted to manually enter a **custom meeting link** (e.g., Zoom, Teams, physical address).  
   2. You can **select a custom start and end time**.  
   3. You’ll also have the option to **make the appointment recurring** with your preferred cadence and duration.
* **Meeting Location**: Choose a default, custom, or integrated video meeting option. If you chose custom, then you would need to provide the custom meeting link.

### **Step 3:** Block Off Time (Optional)

  
The **Blocked Off Time** tab allows you to prevent new appointments from being booked during specific time periods, which is perfect for breaks, personal time, team training, or vacation days. When using this feature, you can choose to block time for a **S** **pecific user** or an entire **calendar** and also specify **Start Time** and **End Time.**

**IMPORTANT:** Use **Blocked Off Time** option to remove availability for specific dates and times. Existing appointments will not be deleted, blocked times only affect new booking availability.
  
  
**Pro Tips:**  
  
1. You can schedule for any team member as long as their calendar is available to you.  
  
2. Time zone handling is automatic and visible in the modal.  
  
3. Use recurring appointments for ongoing sessions or check-ins.  
  
4. Use the "Blocked off time" tab to keep your availability clean and organized
