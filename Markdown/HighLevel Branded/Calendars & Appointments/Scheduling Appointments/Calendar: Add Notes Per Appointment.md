Additionally, these notes are accessible in the Contacts & Conversations tab under the Notes section, helping you keep a detailed history of interactions for each appointment.

### **Types of Notes in the Notes Section**

1. **User-Added Notes**: Any notes manually added by users to the appointment.
2. **Booker’s Additional Information**: If your calendar includes a default form, any data entered by the booker in the _Additional Information_ field during booking will be displayed in the appointment modal’s notes section (but not in the Contacts / Conversations tab). This ensures both the booker’s input and the user-added notes for that specific appointment are visible.
3. **Synced Notes from Third-Party Calendars**: If your calendar is synced with third-party calendars like Google or Outlook (via two-way sync), any appointment descriptions or notes added in those calendars will also appear in the notes section of the Appointment Modal.

  
> **Important**: Notes added in the **Notes** section of the Appointment Modal are not synced to your Google Calendar invite. These notes are for internal system use only. However, any notes or descriptions added to Google Calendar will sync back to your system in HighLevel if two-way sync is enabled.
