# **What Is the Forms Tab in the Appointment Modal?**

  
The _Forms_ tab is a new feature within the Appointment Modal that displays custom form submissions tied to a calendar booking. When an appointment includes a form filled out by the contact during the booking process, the data now appears directly in the modal in a clean, structured layout. This allows for faster review and better context without needing to navigate to the Forms module or the contact record.

## **Key Benefits of Viewing Form Submissions in Appointments**

  
Custom form submissions can contain important contextual information that helps prepare for meetings, consultations, and sales calls. By surfacing this data within the appointment itself, you reduce the need to jump between sections of the platform and increase your team’s efficiency.

 • Instantly view form responses from within the appointment modal

 • Eliminate the need to search for form entries in other modules

 • Reduce preparation time before appointments

 • Improve operational flow for service-based and intake-heavy industries

 • Centralize client data for easier collaboration

## **How to Access Form Submissions from the Appointment Modal**

  
Form submissions can now be viewed directly from any area in the platform where you open the Appointment Modal. Whether you’re working from the Calendars tab, Contacts tab, or Conversations view, you will now have consistent access to form data linked to appointments.

  
To view form submissions:

 1\. Navigate to the **Calendars**, **Contacts**, or **Conversations** area.

 2\. Click on an appointment to open the **Appointment Modal**.

 3\. If the appointment includes a custom form, a new **Forms** tab will appear in the modal.

 4\. Select the **Forms** tab to view the full form submission in a structured layout that mirrors the Forms module.

## **What Types of Forms Are Supported?**

  
This feature currently supports **custom forms** that are added to the calendar as part of a booking process. These are the same forms created and managed through the HighLevel Forms Builder.

  
**Supported Forms**

 • Forms created in the **Forms Builder**

 • Forms embedded in a calendar using the calendar’s **Form settings**

  
**Not Yet Supported**

 • The **default booking form**, which only captures Name, Email, and Phone

  
The reason default forms are excluded for now is because the information they capture is already visible in the **Contact Details** section of the appointment modal. However, support for displaying these in the Forms tab is planned for a future release.

## **Common Use Cases and Efficiency Gains**

  
Having instant access to form submissions is particularly valuable for businesses that rely on collecting detailed client information during the booking process. This integration between Calendars and Forms improves operational efficiency and creates a more seamless user experience.

  
Examples of common use cases include:

 • **Agencies** accessing client discovery forms before strategy calls

 • **Health and wellness providers** viewing patient intake details

 • **Sales professionals** qualifying leads based on custom intake fields

 • **Consultants and coaches** tailoring sessions using client-submitted responses

  
This eliminates unnecessary clicks and supports more informed, productive conversations with clients.
