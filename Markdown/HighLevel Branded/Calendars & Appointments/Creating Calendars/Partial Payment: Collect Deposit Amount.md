#### **What is Partial Payment?**

  
Partial payment offers bookers the opportunity to secure bookings by paying a deposit upfront, with the remaining balance settled at a later time. Alongside collecting full payments, businesses now have the capability to collect deposit amounts from bookers. This feature has been seamlessly implemented across all calendar types and aids in reserving seats.

  
With this new feature, users have the flexibility to determine either a flat amount or a percentage of the total amount to be charged to the booker at the time of booking.
