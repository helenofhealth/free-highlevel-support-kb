# **Overview of Duplicating Calendars**

  
Duplicating calendars creates a brand-new calendar that mirrors the configurations of an existing one. Rather than piecing together your availability, reminders and other settings from scratch, you can clone a proven setup with a single action. This ensures consistency in client experiences and saves valuable time when rolling out similar calendars for different staff, locations, or services.

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

  
**Q: Can I duplicate any calendar type (Round-Robin, Class, Event)?**  
All calendar types support duplication and inherit their unique configurations.  
  
**Q: Are workflows or automations duplicated too?**  
A: No, workflows must be recreated or reassigned to the new calendar manually.

  
**Q: Will existing booking links redirect to the new calendar?**  
No. The booking link from the original calendar remains tied to that calendar and continues pointing to it. The duplicate generates its own unique booking link.

Yes, the duplicate calendar retains the same time zone configuration as the original, ensuring bookings display at the correct local time.
