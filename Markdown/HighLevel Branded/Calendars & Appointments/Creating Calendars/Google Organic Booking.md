## **What is Booking Redirect?**

Google Booking Redirect a.k.a Google Organic Booking refers to the process of customers finding and booking services directly from a business's Google My Business (GMB) listing, without any involvement of third-party booking platforms or paid advertisements. When users search for a specific service or business on Google, and the business has enabled booking functionality through their GMB profile, customers can book appointments or services directly from the search results page or the business's Google Maps listing.

This feature allows businesses to streamline the booking process for potential customers, providing a convenient way for users to schedule appointments without visiting the business's website or using external booking platforms. Google Organic Booking helps businesses attract and convert local customers by making the booking experience seamless and accessible directly from Google search.

## **How to** ****Disable Integration?**

Users have the option to disable Google Organic Booking with a **simple toggle** in Calendar Settings. By disabling the integration, the system refrains from uploading any feed to Google.

**To disable the integration:**

* Navigate to Calendar Settings > Connections Tab
* In the Account Connections tab, locate the Google Organic Booking section.
* Toggle the switch to disable Google Organic Booking.
