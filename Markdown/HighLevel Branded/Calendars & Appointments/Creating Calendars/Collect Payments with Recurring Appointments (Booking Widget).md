Recurring appointments are appointments that repeat according to a set schedule, such as daily, weekly, or monthly.

  
### **Payment Options for Recurring Appointment**

You can accept payments for recurring appointments on the booking widget with two options:

1. **Collect Payment for First Appointment Only**  
   * The payment is collected for the initial appointment only. For example, if you have 3 recurring appointments and the price is $50 per appointment, you will collect $50 at the time of booking. Subsequent payments for the remaining appointments will need to be collected manually.
2. **Collect Payment for All Appointments**  
   * The total amount is collected at the time of booking, covering all appointments in the series. For example, for 3 recurring appointments at $50 each, a total of $150 is collected upfront. However, the final amount charged may vary depending on how many appointments are actually booked. This could change based on your availability and the settings youâ€™ve configured for handling unavailability.

  
**Note:** **Recurring Calendars do not support partial payments.**
