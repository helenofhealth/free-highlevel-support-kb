# What is Calendar Widget Customization?

Calendar Widget Customization is designed to give you control over the appearance and functionality of your widget. With this powerful feature, you can personalize your widget according to your preferences, making it uniquely yours. 

---

## How to Customize your Widget?

* ## Navigate to Calendar Settings
* ## Click on "Edit" for the specific calendar you wish to customize
* ## Head to the "Customizations" tab.

  
## 

Note: Widget Customizations work **ONLY** with **NEO**Â **WIDGET**

**Understanding Customization Options:**

  
Here, you have the freedom to tailor your calendar widget to suit your preferences. Explore the following customization options:

* **Primary Colour:** This will impact buttons, dates, time slots, and various actions within the widget such as Staff Selection, Add Guests etc.

  
* **Background Colour:** The background color sets the tone for both the date-time selector and the form. If you've got a **custom form**, its background will mirror the chosen background color, but the form's fields are determined by your specific custom form settings.
