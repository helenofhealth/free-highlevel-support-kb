# **What is a Service Menu?**

  
Service Menus allow you to list multiple services in one branded interface, enabling clients to book various appointments in a single flow. Each service connects to a separate Service Calendar, giving you full control over availability, staff assignment, pricing, and duration. This is especially useful for businesses that offer several services or work with multiple providers.
