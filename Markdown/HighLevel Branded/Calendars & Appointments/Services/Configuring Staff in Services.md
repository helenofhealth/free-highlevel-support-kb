### **Overview**

  
**Staff** allows you to manage all the individuals responsible for delivering services. Whether you're working solo or managing a team, this panel helps you define working hours, assign services, and configure staff availability with precision. Staff profiles are critical to booking functionality—only services assigned to active, available staff members can be booked by customers.
