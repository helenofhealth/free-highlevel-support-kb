## **How Does Migration Work?**

Once you’ve been enrolled, we’ll automatically migrate your **active** service calendars into the new Services experience to help you switch faster and more easily. Some settings **will not be migrated**, so it’s important to:

* **Review your current settings** after migration.
* **Make any necessary adjustments** to match your preferences.
* You can **continue using the migrated calendars** or **start fresh** by creating new ones.
* Once satisfied, start using services to book appointments!

####

No problem! Simply **start creating new services** to get started.
