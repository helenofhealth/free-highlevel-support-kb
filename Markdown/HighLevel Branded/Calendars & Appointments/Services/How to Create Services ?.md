### **Overview**

**Services** is where you define what your business offers to clients—like coaching sessions, spa treatments, or fitness programs. It helps you create service listings that customers can book online, while keeping things organized behind the scenes. You can manage how and when services are offered, who provides them, and enhance them with optional add-ons or resource management, and organize them into categories. It gives you the flexibility to support both simple bookings and more advanced business flows like multi-location scheduling, custom variations, and upsells.

### **Accessing the Services Panel**

Navigate to **Calendar > Calendar Settings** \> **Services** to access your list of services. Here, you’ll find:

* A searchable and sortable list of all services
* An option to create new services
* Each service's name, duration, price and assigned staff
* Categories on the left-hand side for organizing services
* Actions such as editing, duplicating, deleting and sharing via the three-dot menu

---

### **Creating a New Service**

Click the **\+ New Service** button in the top right. A multi-step configuration panel will open with the following fields and helper text:

* **Service Name** – The title of the service that will be shown to customers.
* **Service Image** \- To visually represent a service and show an image for it
* **Service Color** \- To help identify this service in the calendar
* **Description** – Add a short explanation or brief summary about what this service offers
* **Duration** – Specify how long the service lasts
* **Price** – Set a fixed amount that customers will pay for this service. This field is required.
* **Staff Assignment** – Choose which team members can deliver this service. At least one staff member must be assigned for the service to be bookable.
* **Category** – Select a service category. If none is selected, the service will be placed under the default category.
* **Advanced Settings** – Optional controls that let you fine-tune how the service behaves. These may include settings for buffer time, processing time, payments, and managing add ons and resources.

### **Service Management Features**

### Edit Service

Click the three-dot menu next to a service and choose **Edit**. You’ll be directed to a modular editor with the following panels:

* **Service Details**
* **Add Ons**
* **Resources**

###   

### **Service Details**

* Includes all the basic service related settings, staff members, duration, buffer times (before and after), processing time, variations, pricing, partial payments along with deposit settings.

  
**⭐ Private Service (New)** – Hide this service from the public booking page. It will only be visible to internal users when manually booking appointments or via direct booking links shared with the booker.

  
⭐ **Processing Time (New)**

You can set up processing time to break down the total duration into three distinct phases (initial, processing, and final). The total service duration for customers is the sum of all three phases. Staff members are only needed during the Initial and Final Durations—and they remain available for scheduling during the Processing Duration (wait time).

  
⭐ **Variations** **(New)**

Allows you to offer multiple options within a single service, such as different durations, pricing tiers, or types of the same service. For example, you might offer a 30-minute relaxation massage and a 60-minute deep tissue massage under one service. This helps keep related offerings organized while giving customers the flexibility to choose what suits them best.

  
### **⭐ Add Ons (New)**

Add Ons allow you to enhance services by offering additional features or upsells—such as extra treatments, accessories, or consultation upgrades—giving customers the flexibility to customize their appointments.

Add Ons can be assigned to services either directly through the service editor or from the Add Ons tab. Once linked, they appear on the booking page alongside the main service, allowing customers to select them during booking. Add Ons can also be hidden from the customer view but made available internally to staff through the appointment modal.

###   

### **Resources**

Resources are shared assets like rooms, chairs, stations, or tools that must be available for a service to take place. Assigning resources to services helps prevent double bookings and ensures accurate capacity management.

Each resource can be linked to one or more services and configured by:

* **Location**: Assign where each resource is available.
* **Capacity**: Set how many appointments or people the resource can accommodate.

For example, a "Room 1" resource might be used by several services but can only support 4 people at a time. You can specify this capacity per location for granular control.

###   

### **Creating and Managing Categories**

Categories serve as a way to group similar or relevant services, making it easier for customers to navigate your offerings. These categories are displayed on the booking page, under which specific services are listed.

Drag services to rearrange them within a category. The order is reflected in the booking page layout.

### **Best Practices**

* **Assign Staff** and configure their availability to every service for them to be bookable.
* Organize services meaningfully into categories.
* Leverage **Add Ons** for upsells and custom options.
* Use **Resources** to prevent over-utilization and optimize availability of linked resources
