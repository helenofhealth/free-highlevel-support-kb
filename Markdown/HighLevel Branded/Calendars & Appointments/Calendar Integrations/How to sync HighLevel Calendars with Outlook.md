## **What is the Outlook Calendar integration?** 

Outlook Calendar integration with the CRM is a powerful feature that enables users to synchronize their Outlook Calendar with the platform. This integration allows users to access their Outlook Calendar events in the CRM, ensuring they have all their appointments and meetings in one place. With this integration, users can connect their Outlook account to the CRM and configure their calendar settings to sync their calendar data seamlessly. Users can access their Outlook Calendar events from within their account, manage them directly, and create new appointments that will be reflected in their Outlook Calendar. 

  
### **What are the benefits of this integration?**

* Syncing Outlook Calendar with the CRM enables users to access their appointments and meetings in one place, eliminating the need for manually switching between different applications.
* Users can manage their Outlook Calendar events directly from the CRM, which saves time and effort and enhances their productivity.
* Configuring calendar settings in the CRM ensures seamless synchronization of calendar data, which enables users to stay on top of their schedules and never miss necessary appointments.
* Users can create new CRM appointments reflected in their Outlook Calendar, ensuring that all data is current across both platforms.

###   
**Who will benefit the most from this integration?**

The Outlook Calendar integration with the CRM benefits users and businesses that rely heavily on scheduling appointments and managing calendars. This includes sales and marketing teams, project managers, small business owners, and professionals who manage their schedules across multiple platforms.

**Supported Outlook Accounts**

Our Outlook sync integration **only supports** Office 365 and Outlook.com accounts. We **do not support** Outlook Desktop (on-premise) integration.

To determine if your Outlook events will be synced:

  
â **Check your Outlook Calendar online**

1. Go to [Outlook Calendar](https://outlook.office.com/calendar/) and log in with your credentials.
2. If you can see your calendar events here, they **will sync successfully** after connecting your account.

  
â **Unsupported Scenarios**

* If you use **Outlook Desktop** and your events are **not synced to the cloud**, our integration **will not** be able to sync those events.
* We **do not** support Outlook accounts that are hosted on **on-premise Exchange servers.**
