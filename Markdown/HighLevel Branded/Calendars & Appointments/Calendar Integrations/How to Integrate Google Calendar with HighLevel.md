## **Frequently Asked Questions**

  
**Q: Why isn’t my calendar syncing?**

Check if **permissions were fully granted** during integration. Try disconnecting and re-integrating your Google Calendar using the [Re-Integration Guide](https://help.gohighlevel.com/en/support/solutions/articles/48001181302).

  
**Q: I don’t see my Google Calendar listed — what should I do?**

Ensure that you’re logged into the **correct Google account**. Log out of all Google accounts and reconnect using the correct one.

  
**Q: What causes Google Calendar sync to break?**

* Token expiry
* Calendar deleted
* Permissions revoked after connection

  
**Refer to:** [Why Google Calendar Integration Breaks and How to Fix it](https://help.gohighlevel.com/en/support/solutions/articles/48001204159). 

  
**Q: Can I use one calendar across multiple users?**

No, calendar integrations are **user-specific**. Each user must connect their own Google Calendar for personalized scheduling and sync.

  
**Q. Can I sync multiple Google Calendars?**

Yes, you can link **multiple Google Calendars**. Configure one calendar as the **Linked Calendar** for bookings and others as **Conflict Calendars** to avoid double bookings.

No, both personal Gmail accounts and G Suite (Google Workspace) accounts work with this integration.
