## **Frequently Asked Questions**

  
**Q: Can I create a calendar directly from the Group Calendar setup screen?**

No. You must first create individual calendars under the Calendars tab. Once those are created, you can assign them to a Group Calendar. Group Calendars are containers — they don’t create or configure individual calendars on their own.

  
**Q: Can I group Class or Collective calendars?**

No. Group Calendars are separate from Class and Collective calendar types. Each has its own structure and behavior. You can use separate booking flows for those calendar types based on your use case.

  
**Q: What happens if I delete a calendar inside a group?**

The group calendar will still exist, but the deleted calendar will no longer appear as a booking option. Always verify group composition after editing or deleting calendars.

  
**Q: How to share or embed a Group calendar?**

Check the HighLevel calendar [embedding guide](https://help.gohighlevel.com/en/support/solutions/articles/48000982201).

  
**Q: Can I Show Multiple Calendars Without Using a Calendar Group?**

Yes, for more information checkout our guide [here](https://help.gohighlevel.com/en/support/solutions/articles/48001049320).
