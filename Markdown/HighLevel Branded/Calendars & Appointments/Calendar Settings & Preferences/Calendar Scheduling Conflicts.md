In Teams/Group calendars (Round Robin, Service, Class, and Collective Calendars), appointments assigned to a particular user can be synced to Third Party Calendars (Google / Outlook / iCloud) and the events from Third Party Calendars can be read and synced to the CRM.

  
You can configure your calendar under Settings > My Profile. There are primarily two settings, Primary Calendar and Check for Conflicts. All the third party calendar integrations added by the User are shown here.

# **Check for Scheduling Conflicts**

  
All the Google/Outlook/iCloud calendars integrated by the user will be shown here.

  
As the name suggests, we read all the events from the selected calendar and block off the timings when the user is not available. Essentially, all events imported from Google/Outlook/iCloud will be blocked, disallowing any appointments during those times.

  
In the Check for Conflicts section, we do not create any appointments. If a calendar is disabled in Check for Conflicts, it implies that it is already selected in the Primary Calendar."
