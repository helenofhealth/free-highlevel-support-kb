# **What is List View in the Mobile Calendar?**

  
List View is a new calendar display format available in the HighLevel and LeadConnector **mobile apps**. Unlike the traditional grid-based layouts (monthly or weekly), List View displays your calendar events in a **chronologically ordered, scrollable feed**. This setup eliminates visual clutter and allows users to focus on what’s coming up—event by event—especially helpful when using a smaller screen.

  
## **Key Benefits of Using List View**

  
**List View is optimized for clarity, speed, and ease-of-use, especially on smaller screens. Here’s why you’ll love it:**

* **Linear Planning**: View events in a straightforward, top-to-bottom list—no calendar grid needed.
* **Mobile-Friendly Display**: Makes the most of limited screen space by minimizing visual distractions.
* **Scroll-Based Navigation**: Browse through your full calendar by simply scrolling—no need to tap between days.
* **Focus-Friendly**: Easily focus on today’s agenda or scroll ahead to prepare for future events.
* **Smooth Toggle Access**: Quickly switch between List View and other views with a single tap.

## **Feature Highlight: Perfect for Mobile Planning**

  
**List View is tailor-made for mobile users who want efficiency, visibility, and control in one clean layout.**

  
On smaller screens, the traditional grid views can feel dense and harder to interpret. With List View, every event is given its own space, and users can move fluidly through their schedule. Whether you’re checking what’s next today or planning out next week, List View simplifies the process and removes friction from your workflow.
