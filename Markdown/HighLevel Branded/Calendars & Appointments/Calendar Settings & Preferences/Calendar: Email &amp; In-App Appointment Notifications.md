**Date Updated:** 2025-05-29T18:15:51.000Z

We’ve introduced customizable email notifications for your Calendars! You can now send tailored emails when appointments are booked, canceled, rescheduled, or need reminders or follow-ups. Notifications can be configured for Contacts, Guests, Users, and any additional email addresses you specify. This feature allows you to streamline notifications to suit your business needs, ensuring effective communication with your customers.

  
**IMPORTANT**: Notifications are delivered via **Email and In-App** only by default. If you wish to send **text (SMS) notifications**, you will need to configure this through **Workflows**. For example, you can add a **"Send SMS"** action following the **"Appointment Booked"** trigger. Setting up such a workflow ensures that customers receive SMS notifications in addition to the default channels.

## **Important Notes**

  
### **In-App Notifications:**

1. The in-app notification configuration is customisable - for example, you can turn on the confirmation notification for the calendar but keep all other types turned off.
2. For **Event Calendars**, the default setting is that account admins will receive the notifications.
3. For other calendar types, the **assigned user** will be selected by default to receive notifications.

  
### **Email Notifications:**

1. **Additional Emails** refers to any extra recipients you want to notify. Simply add their email addresses, and they’ll receive the notifications as well.
2. You can create your email templates through the **Email Builder** in **Marketing module > Emails > Templates.**
3. Ensure you have added a **subject line in your email template** for successful delivery.
4. If you have enabled the **Add Guest** function and have included a custom form, you can send that custom form to the guest as well. Enabling this option will send a system-generated email to guests with a link to the custom form once their appointment is confirmed. To prevent duplicate emails, ensure a separate confirmation email is not already set up for guests (verify this in the Notifications tab under **Confirmation Notification**).
