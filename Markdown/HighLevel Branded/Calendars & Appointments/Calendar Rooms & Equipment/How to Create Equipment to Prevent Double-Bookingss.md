# **What is Equipment?**

  
Equipment refers to shared tools, devices, or physical resources that are needed for services offered in your business — like projectors, therapy tables, or treatment chairs. When added to your system, these resources can be linked to calendars and availability settings to prevent scheduling conflicts. This ensures that only available equipment is booked, allowing for smooth operations and improved client experiences.

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

  
**Q: What is the difference between Rooms and Equipment?**  
Rooms are physical spaces, like offices or studios. Equipment refers to tools or resources, like chairs or machines. Both can be scheduled as resources.

  
**Q: Can equipment be assigned to more than one calendar?**  
Yes. Equipment can be linked to multiple calendars, but it can only be used in one appointment at a time.

  
**Q: How do I add multiple versions of the same equipment?**

You can set the quantity for each equipment item during creation. For example, if you have three identical massage tables, you only need to create one entry (e.g., “Massage Table”) and set the quantity to 3.

  
**Q: What happens if I delete equipment that is in use?**  
Deleting it may affect scheduling and remove the availability restrictions tied to it. Review connected calendars before removing any equipment.

  
**Q: Can I generate reports for equipment usage?**  
There is no native reporting for equipment usage, but appointments tied to specific resources can be reviewed manually via calendars.
