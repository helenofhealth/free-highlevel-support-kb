## **What Are Round Robin Calendars and how do they work?**

  
A **Round Robin Calendar** is a scheduling system that automatically distributes appointments among assigned team members. It ensures **fair workload distribution** and **optimizes availability** by automatically checking which team member is available at the requested time. Some key points about **Round Robin Calendars**:

* **At least one team member** must be assigned to a Round Robin Calendar during setup.
* When a customer **requests an appointment**, the system first checks the **availability of the first assigned team member**.
* If the first team member is **not available**, it automatically moves to the **next team member**.
* This continues until an **available team member** is found.
* If **no team members** are available at the selected time, the system **prevents customers from booking an empty slot**, ensuring they only see valid appointment options.

**Key Benefit:** Customers only book appointments when a team member is actually available, eliminating scheduling conflicts and reducing manual intervention.
