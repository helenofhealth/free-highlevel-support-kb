When **{{appointment.start\_time}}** or **any other appointment custom values** are not showing

  
Or When the appointment reminder campaign is not firing properly according to the appointment start time:

  
Or when the Add to Google calendar / Add to iCal/Outlook link is not working when sending a test email.

We will need the **Appointment** or **Customer booked appointment** trigger in order for the **{{appointment.start\_time}}** or **any other appointments custom values** to show up. To test the Custom Values, you will need to book an actual appointment.

  
If you use the **Pipeline stage changed** as the trigger, HighLevel won't know which appointment it is.

Same with Workflows:

  
We need to use **Appointment** or **Customer booked appointment** as the workflow trigger:

  
To test the Custom Values, you will need to **book an actual appointment**.

If you need to manually add the lead to the **Appointment Reminder** Campaign, you will need to select the **appointment start time** as the **event start date.**

To reschedule manually, you could go to the **Appointments** tab on the right and switch **Confirmed** to **Reschedule**. This will automate the process of removing the leads out of the original appointment reminder campaign and re-adding them to the appointment reminder campaign again with the new appointment time.

If you want your leads to be able to reschedule themselves, you could choose the **reschedule link** from the Custom Values in the appointment reminder campaign:
