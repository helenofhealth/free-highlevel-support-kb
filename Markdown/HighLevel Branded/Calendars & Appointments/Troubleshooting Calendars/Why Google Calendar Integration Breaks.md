## **What Causes the Google Calendar Integration to Break?**

  
When Google Calendar integration is disrupted, it's usually caused by one of the following:  
  
* The user changed their Google account password.
* Permissions for HighLevel were revoked in Google settings.
* Google detected suspicious activity and automatically blocked access.
* OAuth tokens (used for secure connections) expired or were invalidated.

When this happens, calendar syncing stops, and users may not see new appointments reflected in Google Calendar.

## **How to Fix a Broken Google Calendar Integration**

  
When your Google calendar disconnects or fails to sync, it's typically because Google has revoked access to HighLevel. This can happen due to a password change, revoked permissions, or security triggers in your Google account.Follow these steps to re-authenticate your Google Calendar integration in HighLevel:

###   
**Step 1:** Delete Google Calendar

###   

* Navigate to **Settings** from your sub-account.
* Select the **My Profile** Option and navigate to **Calendar Settings.**
* **Click on the Bin/Delete icon of the connected Google Account**
* Check the **a** **cknowledgement box** from the pop-up and click on **Confirm**

  
### **Step 2:** Re-Integrate Google Calendar

  
* Click on your sub-account **Settings** and select **My Profile** option.
* Under **Calendar Settings**, click on the **\+ Add New** button.

  
### **Step 3:** Test and Confirm

  
After you finish the re-integration process, test your Google calendar to make sure the syncing process works the way it should. If you are still experiencing issues after testing, please contact Customer Support for further assistance.
