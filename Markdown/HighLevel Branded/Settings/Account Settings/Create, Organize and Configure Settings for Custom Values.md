## **What Are Custom Values?**

  
The Custom Value function is a Key and a Value that can be accessed anywhere in the platform. Instead of writing the same value over and over again in many places, you can write the Key everywhere. Then, if you change the one Value in the Custom Values list, the Key will be updated everywhere automatically.
