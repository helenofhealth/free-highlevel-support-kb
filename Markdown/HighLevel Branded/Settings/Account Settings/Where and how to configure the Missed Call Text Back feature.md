Do you want to avoid missing important calls and potentially losing out on business opportunities? HighLevel offers a convenient missed-call-text-back feature to help you stay on top of your game. This feature can quickly be able and allows you to send a text to missed calls automatically. This will ensure you take advantage of every chance to connect with your prospects or clients when they need you most.

  
In this how-to guide, we'll take you through everything you need to know to set up and use the HighLevel missed-call-text-back feature, so you can streamline your communication and focus on growing your business. Let's get started!
  
  
**Please Note:**

The missed-call-text-back feature will trigger an SMS notification for every missed call, even if the caller tries multiple times within a brief timeframe.  
  
To avoid receiving multiple SMS notifications for missed calls, it is suggested to [create and customize the existing recipe in workflows](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZwvCPUxgMaM) and personalize it to manage according to your preference (Try adding a 20+/- min  wait step, or filter using tags - 1st call, 2nd call etc).

### **Customize the Message Content**

  
Once you’ve clicked the Customize button, this opens a pop-up where you can craft your automated response message. In the Enter message field, type the content you want sent when a call is missed. You can also use the custom value tag icon to insert dynamic placeholders such as the contact’s name—just remember, these only work if the system already recognizes the contact from a prior interaction.
