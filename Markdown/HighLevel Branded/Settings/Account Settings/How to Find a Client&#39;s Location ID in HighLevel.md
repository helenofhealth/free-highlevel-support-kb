When you interact with our support teams, they may request you to provide a location ID where you face a problem. Location ID is a unique ID given to every sub-account in your agency account. This helps us identify your client's account and narrow down out trouble shooting efforts. 
  
  
To locate the location ID, follow these steps:

  
1. From the **Sub-Account Dashboard,** go to **S** **ettings** in lower right-hand corner
