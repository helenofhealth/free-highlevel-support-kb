# **Understanding Wallet Balances**

  
The Wallet feature allows you to add a bulk amount of money to your account in a single transaction, and that money is then converted into credits. When you use services that would cost your account money, you would spend credits instead.

  
Once your wallet credits go below a certain amount (determined by the account user/owner), your default credit card will automatically be charged and more credits will be added to your wallet, preventing any interruption from paid services.

  
Some of the benefits of the wallet system are:

  
* **View Current Balance:** See your available funds at a glance.
* **Monitor Complimentary Credits:** Track any complimentary credits provided.
* **Manage Funds:** Add funds to your wallet to ensure uninterrupted services.

# **Frequently Asked Questions**
  
  
**Q: Why arenâ€™t my customers receiving receipts for wallet reloads or SaaS plan rebills?**

Customers do not automatically receive receipts for wallet credit reloads (e.g. $25 top-ups for usage like SMS or email). These wallet transactions are visible to the agency but are not sent to the client by default. For SaaS plan rebills, receipts are handled by Stripe. To ensure clients receive them, go to your Stripe account > Settings > Email Receipts, and enable receipt emails for successful payments.

  
**Q: How can I add a new payment method?**

Navigate to the Payment Methods section within the Billing area, click on 'Add New Card,' and enter the required card details.  
  
**Q: Is it possible to have multiple active subscriptions?**

Yes, you can manage multiple subscriptions, including SaaS, Reselling, and Marketplace apps, all from the Subscriptions section.  
  
**Q: How do I update my billing address?**

In the Billing section, locate the Billing Information area and click on 'Edit' to update your billing address.
