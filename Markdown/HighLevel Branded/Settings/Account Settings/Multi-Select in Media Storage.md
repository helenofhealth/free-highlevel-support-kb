# **Frequently Asked Questions**

  
**Q: Can I select files across different folders using Multi-Select?**

Currently, Multi-Select allows selection within a single folder. To manage files across different folders, perform actions within each folder separately.
  
  
**Q: Are there any file types that cannot be selected using Multi-Select?**

Multi-Select supports all file types available in Media Storage. However, certain actions may be restricted based on file type. For example, some file types may not support previewing.
  
  
**Q: How does Multi-Select handle files with the same name during bulk actions?**

If you move or download multiple files with the same name, the system will prompt you to rename or skip files to prevent overwriting.
  
  
**Q: Is there a limit to the number of files I can select at once?**

You can select up to 100 files at a time for bulk actions. Attempting to select more than this limit will prompt a notification.
