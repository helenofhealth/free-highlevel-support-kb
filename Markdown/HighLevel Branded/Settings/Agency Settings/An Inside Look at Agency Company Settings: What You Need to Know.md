### **1\. Logo & Branding**

  
Upload your agency logo to display in key client-facing areas such as the login screen, app header, and system-generated emails. A clear, professional logo helps reinforce your brand identity across the platform.

   * Login screen  
   * App header

### **4\. Custom Code (JS & CSS)**

  
Use custom code to style your agency dashboard and add third-party tools or custom logic. This is powerful but should be used cautiously, as changes to the HighLevel platform could impact how your code functions.

**IMPORTANT**: Custom JS/CSS is powerful but unsupported. Changes made to HighLevel’s core UI may break your code. Always test thoroughly.
