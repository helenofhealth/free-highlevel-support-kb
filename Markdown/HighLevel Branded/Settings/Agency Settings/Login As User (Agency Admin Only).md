**Note:** This is accessible for Agency Admin users only. Users with other roles will not see this option. 

  
This feature allows Agency Admins to step in as their Users; whether that is to troubleshoot, configure, update settings or respond to a customer as the user they logged in as. Previously agency admins had to log out & log in multiple times to make any changes in their users’ accounts or to respond on behalf of their customers. In this article, we will cover how to switch between users.

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

**Q: How do audit logs register the changes made by the Agency Admin when logged in as the user?**

In this first phase of this release, we will capture the account user’s details (not agency admin’s) as a change log on the Audit Log page. The next phase of this release when it is developed will capture the agency admin & the account user’s details on Audit Logs.
