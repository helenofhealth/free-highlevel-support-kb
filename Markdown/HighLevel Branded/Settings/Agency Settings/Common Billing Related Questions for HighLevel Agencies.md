## **Frequently Asked Questions**

  
**Q: Why was I charged twice this month?**  
Charges may include prorated upgrades or failed previous attempts. Check the invoice section for breakdown.

  
**Q: What if I signed up via another agency?** 
Contact your Agency Admin for any subscription changes. HighLevel cannot process cancellations for agency-managed accounts.

  
**Q: Can I switch between monthly and yearly billing?** 
Yes. When upgrading, you can toggle between billing cycles.

  
**Q: Will my data be deleted if I cancel?** 
Your data is retained but inaccessible. You can reactivate to regain access.

  
**Q: I can’t see the modify/cancel button. What should I do?** 
Reach out to support via live chat. They can assist or escalate your request.

  
**Q: What does “Email Notification” mean in Wallet Transactions?**

“Email Notification” refers to transactional emails (like confirmation emails, workflow-based messages, or other automated sends) that use **LC Email**, HighLevel’s built-in email service. These messages are **billed per send** and deducted from your Wallet balance.

  
If you’re seeing charges labeled this way, it means your account is actively sending emails via LC Email. You can review and confirm these in Settings > Billing > Wallet Transactions and check corresponding sends in the **Email Logs** under Marketing > Emails > Logs.
