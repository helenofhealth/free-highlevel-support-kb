## **What is a Subaccount/Location in HighLevel?**

  
A sub-account (location) in HighLevel is an independent business or client account that operates within an agency. It allows businesses to manage their marketing, automation, and customer relationships separately from other accounts. Each sub-account has its own CRM, workflows, campaigns, integrations and other key features.

## **Why Would You Need to Delete a Subaccount?**

  
* **Client No Longer Uses the Platform:** If a client decides to discontinue using HighLevel, deleting the sub-account may be necessary.
* **Duplicate or Unused Accounts:** Sometimes, businesses create multiple sub-accounts by mistake. Deleting the extra ones helps keep the system organized.
* **Cost Management:** Reducing the number of active sub-accounts can help manage billing costs.
* **Security and Compliance:** If an account is no longer needed, deleting it ensures that sensitive customer data is removed from the system.

* **Integration Disconnection:** Ensure that **Twilio, Mailgun, Facebook, Google, and other third-party integrations** are disconnected.
* **Pausing Instead of Deleting:** If you're unsure, you can **pause** the sub-account instead of permanently deleting a subaccount.
