The Optimize Experience section of your Agency Settings is where you can control features we use to gather feedback, educate new users, and notify users.

  
By default, these will be enabled so you will need to disable these if you would like to have them turned off.

## **NPS Surveys**

NPS Surveys are pop-up surveys that are occasionally used to gather feedback about new features in order to continually improve the app's UI/UX. The surveys are always white-labeled and never mention HighLevel or its branding.

##   
**Daily Updates**

Daily updates are white-labeled email notifications that get sent out to end users notifying them of important things like new reviews so they can reply as quickly as possible. 

These updates will evolve into a "daily snapshot report", which will contain information about new reviews, average response time, etc.
