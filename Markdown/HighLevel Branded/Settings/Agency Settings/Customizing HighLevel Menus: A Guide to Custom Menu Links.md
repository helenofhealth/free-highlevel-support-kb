## **What Are Custom Menu Links?**

  
Custom Menu Links allow agencies to personalize the HighLevel navigation menu for sub-accounts and agency users. These links help direct users to essential external resources, training materials, or frequently accessed tools, improving workflow efficiency. This customization enhances user experience and allows for better navigation within the HighLevel platform.

  
Custom Menu Links can be configured in three ways:

  
* **Embedded Page (iFrame):** Displays the external page within HighLevel while maintaining the navigation structure.
* **New Browser Tab:** Opens the link in a separate browser tab, keeping HighLevel open in the background.
* **Current Browser Tab:** Replaces the current HighLevel screen with the linked content, directing users outside of the platform.

These options provide flexibility based on how agencies want their users to interact with external tools and resources.

## **Key Benefits of Custom Menu Links**

  
Custom Menu Links offer various advantages, including:

  
* **Streamlined Navigation:** Centralized access to frequently used external tools, reducing the time spent switching between different platforms.
* **Increased Productivity:** Users can quickly access essential resources without leaving the HighLevel interface.
* **Better Training & Support Access:** Agencies can provide direct links to help documentation, knowledge bases, or customer support portals.
* **Seamless Third-Party Integrations:** Directly embed external dashboards, affiliate portals, or reporting tools within the platform.

## **Who Can Manage Custom Menu Links?**

  
Only **Agency Admins** can create and manage Custom Menu Links, ensuring that only authorized personnel can add or remove navigation options.

  
To adjust these permissions, navigate to **Settings > Team**. Select the team member whose permissions need updating and ensure the "Manage Custom Menu Links" permission is enabled.

## **How to Create and Manage Custom Menu Links**

  
Learn how to add and configure custom menu links that appear in the navigation sidebar for agency and sub-account users. These steps will help you seamlessly integrate external tools and resources directly into your HighLevel workspace. Follow these steps to create a new Custom Menu Link:  
  
**Step 1:** Navigate to **Settings > Custom Menu Links** in the left-hand menu and click on the **Create New** button at the top right.  
  
![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155044018239/original/KM6Ct_F5HuuTQ_y-i6CNLucTa_OlPZ4wEA.png?1742996694)  
  
**Step 2:** Fill in the required details:

  
* **Link Icon:** Click to select an icon.
* **Link Title:** Enter the name of the menu link.
* **URL:** Provide the external URL to be linked. You may use Location values and Custom Values in here. (These will only work on the Location sidebar when inside an account.)  
Example: <http://url.com/{{location.id}}?value={{custom%5Fvalues.my%5Fvalue}}>  
    
![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155044019159/original/ycCTWqoFnkAWHtYuDPTDZurOg3VbC-e91Q.gif?1742997208)  
    
**IMPORTANT:**  The **Link URL** is the web address where the menu item will direct users. It must begin with `http://` or `https://`. Make sure the destination page allows embedding if using the Embedded Page (iFrame) option.

  
**Step 3:** Choose the opening method:

  
* **Open in an Embedded Page (iFrame):** Displays the linked content directly within the HighLevel dashboard, keeping users in the same interface. Ideal for tools that support embedding.
* **Open in a New Browser Tab:** Opens the link in a separate tab, allowing users to access the resource without leaving their current HighLevel view.
* **Open in the Current Tab:** Redirects the current HighLevel tab to the linked URL. Best used when users are expected to complete tasks outside the platform.

**Step 4:** Set **Sidebar Preference** and **Role-Based Visibility**  
  
Set the **Sidebar Preference** and **Role-Based Visibility** to define where the link appears and who can access it. The **Sidebar Preference** allows you to choose whether the link appears in the Agency sidebar, the Sub-Account sidebar, or both:

* Selecting the **Agency sidebar** will make the link visible to agency-level users.
* Selecting the **Sub-Account's sidebar** enables you to assign the link to specific sub-accounts only. Once selected, you can choose which subaccounts should display the custom menu link.
* **Role-Based Visibility** lets you control which types of users can see the custom menu link:**All:** The link will be visible to all roles. **User:** Only users with the User role will see the link. **Admin:** Only Admins will have access to the link.

## **Getting the user's context within the Custom Menu Link**

  
While creating the Custom Menu Link, you can set the URL like this:

https://test.com/test?fname={{user.first\_name}}&lname={{user.last\_name}}&location\_id={{location.id}}&custom\_value\_example={{custom\_values.example\_field\_name}}

  
This way, when a user clicks on the link, HighLevel will dynamically replace the param variables with actual values based on the user's context. You can extract these params from the URL and get the user's context.

  
**Supported params to CML**

user.first\_name

user.last\_name

user.name

user.phone

user.email

location.id

location.name

location.city

location.state

location.country

location.address

location.email

location.phone

location.postal\_code

location.full\_address

location.website

location.logo\_url

location\_owner.first\_name

location\_owner.last\_name

location\_owner.email

custom\_values.{CUSTOM\_VALUE\_NAME}
