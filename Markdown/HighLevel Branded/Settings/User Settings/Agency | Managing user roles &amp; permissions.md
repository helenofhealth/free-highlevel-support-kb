# Getting started with user permissions

To manage users' permissions for an agency, 

* Navigate to Settings > Team.
* Click on the edit icon for the user whose permissions you want to edit.
* Click on 'Roles & Permissions' in the left menu.

# Assigning user type and role

* **User Type**: Select whether you wish to create the user for the agency or a specific sub-account.
* **Role**: Select whether the user is an admin or a user.

# Restrict access to specific sub-accounts

Agency admins can assign agency admins to specific sub-accounts and restrict them from accessing other sub-accounts to which they are not assigned. 

For example, Alex, who is an agency admin, can access only assigned sub-accounts '78th Avenue' and 'A Mailbox NYC', without compromising his access level. However, he will not be able to access 'Baker's Inn' which he is not assigned to.

# Assign permissions

Agency admins can apply granular permissions to their users. You may control the permissions at two levels:

* Module: Toggle the module off to completely restrict access to the module.
* Granular: Using checboxes, you can set the permissions at a granular level.

The new permissions structure is backward compatible with the old set of permission structures and their functionalities.

# Copy permissions

Agency admins can copy a user’s granular permissions to another user. For example, when Bob joins the sales team, the admin can clone Alex’s permissions to Bob.
