1\. Ask them which Internet service provider (ISP) they are using

  
If they have **Verizon Fios**, they may disable protection here:

If they have **CenturyLink**, they may disable secure wifi here: 

<https://kb.plu.edu/page.php?id=109248>

  
If they have had **Survey Junkie** before, they may uninstall to see if it will work as it will update all SSL certificates on your website.

  
If they have **McAfee** installed, they may turn off web protection here

<https://www.help.k12.com/s/article/McAfee-Web-Protection-Enable-Disable>

  
If they have **xfinity**, please check

If they are using **Spectrum**, they may turn off Security Shield here:

<https://www.spectrum.net/support/internet/security-shield>

  
We will be working on a long-term solution in the meantime. As long as the user is browsing secure websites on their device, turning off the protection feature should not bring any risks.
  
  
2\. If they are not using the ISP mentioned above:
