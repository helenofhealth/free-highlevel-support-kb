# **What is the Account User/Admin Role?**

  
Account-level users and admins are restricted to selected sub-accounts. Unlike agency-level users, they do not have visibility or control over the entire agency. This setup is ideal for giving team members access to multiple locations without compromising sensitive agency-wide settings.

## **Key Benefits of Account-Level Access**

  
* Granular Permissions: Limit access to only the locations they need.
* Secure Delegation: Avoid giving unnecessary agency-wide visibility.
* Flexible Management: Add users as Admins or Users based on required capabilities.

Yes. When assigning sub-account access, you can select multiple locations.

Account Admins can manage most settings within assigned sub-accounts, while Users typically have restricted access based on toggled permissions.
