## **Step-by-Step Domain Connection Process**

There are two main ways to connect a domain to HighLevel:

### **1\. Automatic Method (For Supported Providers)**

If your domain is registered with a **supported provider** (like GoDaddy, Google Domains, or Cloudflare), you can connect it automatically via API-based authentication.

**Steps:**

1. Go to Sites > **Settings > Domains** in your HighLevel account.
2. Choose **“Connect a Domain”**.
3. Choose the product you'd like to connect (e.g., funnel, website, email).![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155045491132/original/mGa9aDaXW4Ytb7xL12a6RFqhz1BiTtLGPw.png?1745385425)
4. Enter your root domain or subdomain in the provided field. If adding the "www" subdomain as well, you'll see an option to add the root domain.
5. If your domain is with Google Domains, Go Daddy, or Cloudflare, you'll see an "Authorize" button. Click on it to allow Domain Connect to access your DNS settings.
6. Follow the on-screen prompts to complete the authorization process on your domain provider's interface. This will automatically add or connect the required DNS records.
7. Once authorization is complete, close that tab and return to the Domain Connect interface.

> Recommended if your domain is managed by one of our integrated providers.

### **2\. Manually Adding a Domain**

If your domain is hosted by **Namecheap, Bluehost, or any provider not listed**, you'll need to add DNS records manually.

**Steps:**

1. Navigate to **Sites** \> **Settings > Domains.**
2. Choose **“Connect a Domain.”**
3. Choose the product you'd like to connect (e.g., funnel, website, email).![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155045491132/original/mGa9aDaXW4Ytb7xL12a6RFqhz1BiTtLGPw.png?1745385425)
4. If you want to connect the domain to a funnel, website, blog or webinar enter the domain name as per the prompt.
5. Click on the add records manually option.![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155045491766/original/Z5xJ2bdqGdqayjfdHK7wGVVP5Vs5lKUqiQ.png?1745385962)
6. You'll receive specific DNS records (A Records, CNAME, TXT) that need to be added in your domain registrar.![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155045491792/original/YCI8-DHpBnHtPNr9frNnfoVS4BElSM4SkQ.png?1745385993)
7. Log into your domain provider (e.g., Namecheap), and navigate to DNS settings.
8. Add the records exactly as shown.
9. Save changes and wait for DNS propagation (can take up to 24 hours).

> Use this option if your provider is not directly supported.

## **Products You Can Connect a Domain To**

### Funnel / Website / Store / Webinar / Blog

* Use your domain to **host customer-facing pages** such as funnels, ecommerce stores, webinars, or blogs.

### WordPress

* If you're using **HighLevel's WordPress hosting**, point your domain to your WordPress site using provided DNS records.
* The system will auto-detect and validate once DNS setup is complete.
* You can read more about it here - [WordPress: Domain Connect Integration](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/155000004155-wordpress-domain-connect-integration)

* **SSL** is automatically provisioned once the domain is connected and records are correct.
* You can manage all connected domains under **Settings > Domains**.
* If your domain says **“Pending”** for over 24 hours, double-check DNS values or reach out to support.
