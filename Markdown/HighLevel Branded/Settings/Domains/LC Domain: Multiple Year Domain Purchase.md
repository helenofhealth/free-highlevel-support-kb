# What is Multi-Year Domain Purchase?

The multi-year domain purchase feature allows you to register a new domain for more than one year — up to 10 years (depending on the TLD). Instead of renewing your domain annually, you can choose to secure it for multiple years during the initial checkout process.

This feature is designed to help businesses and individuals manage their domains more proactively and ensure brand consistency without the hassle of yearly renewals.

## Important Notes on Multi-Year Purchases

To ensure you make the most of this feature, keep the following points in mind:

* Most TLDs (Top-Level Domains) can be registered for up to 10 years.
* The .co family of TLDs (.co, .com.co, .net.co, .nom.co) supports up to 5 years of registration.
* If the renewal price is different from the initial registration price for a given TLD, the domain can only be registered for 1 year at the time of purchase.

## Why This Feature Matters

Long-term domain registration isn’t just a convenience — it’s a proactive strategy for protecting your brand and online presence. By locking in your domain for multiple years, you minimize the risk of accidental expiration, simplify management, and ensure that your business remains accessible to your audience without interruption.

## Frequently Asked Questions

Q: Can I extend my domain registration later if I only choose 1 year now?  
 Yes! You can always renew or extend your domain registration at a later time.

Q: Why can't some domains be purchased for more than 1 year?  
 If the renewal price differs from the registration price for a specific TLD, registration is limited to 1 year to comply with registry rules.

Q: Will I receive reminders before my multi-year registration ends?  
 Yes. You’ll still receive renewal reminders before your domain registration period ends to ensure you have the option to renew in advance.

Q: Does purchasing for multiple years change my renewal price?  
 No. Your upfront payment covers the total cost of the selected registration period. Renewal pricing in future years will follow standard rates at that time.
