## Overview: What is Domain Transfer In?

The Domain Transfer In feature allows users to transfer their domain name from an external registrar (such as GoDaddy, Namecheap, etc.) to our platform. Once transferred, users can manage their domain's DNS, billing, and security directly within the platform.

Bringing domains in offers convenience and helps users centralize all aspects of domain management in one place. It also contributes to improved customer retention and engagement.

## Eligibility Check

During the Eligibility Check, We verify whether your domain qualifies to be transferred into the platform. The system evaluates both registrar-level rules and technical readiness. If the domain is eligible for transfer you can continue with the transfer process. When a domain is eligible for transfer you can see the 

* Domain Name

* Applicable fee for the extension of expiry date.

### A domain is not eligible for transfer when:

* Its current registrar is not supported.
* It has been previously purchased internally.
* Itâ€™s TLD is not supported.
* It has been purchased or transferred in last 60 days
* It has an EPP status that does not allow for transfers (eg, pendingDelete, redemptionPeriod, serverHold etc)
* The transfer would result in the term of the domain exceeding the maximum allowed term
* Other reason

In these cases, the Continue button will be disabled, and a relevant error message will explain why the domain cannot be transferred at this time.
