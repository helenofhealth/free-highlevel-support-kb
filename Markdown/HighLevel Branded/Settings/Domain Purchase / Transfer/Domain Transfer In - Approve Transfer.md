Overview

Once you’ve submitted your domain transfer request, the final step is to approve the transfer at your current registrar. Until you do that, the transfer stays in a pending state and won’t complete.

## Why Approval Is Required

Domain transfers require explicit confirmation from your current registrar (such as GoDaddy, Namecheap, or IONOS) to protect against unauthorized changes. You must manually approve the transfer either through your email inbox or your registrar’s dashboard.

If no action is taken, the transfer may auto-approve after 5–7 days, depending on the registrar’s policy.

## What Happens After Approval

Once you approve the transfer:

* You’ll see it listed under Internal Domains in your account
* You can manage DNS, renewals, and billing right inside our platform
* The Manage button becomes active so you can take further actions

Your transfer can be rejected if:

* You manually cancel it
* Your registrar blocks it (e.g., 60-day lock)
* You don’t approve it in time

When this happens:

* The domain status shows as Rejected
* The Transfer to Us button reappears so you can try again

## FAQs

1\. Can I transfer my domain back to another registrar later?

Yes but typically, you’ll need to wait 60 days after the last transfer, per ICANN rules.

  
2\. Will transferring my domain cause downtime?

Not if DNS records are accurately reviewed and migrated before the transfer. Always cross-check.
