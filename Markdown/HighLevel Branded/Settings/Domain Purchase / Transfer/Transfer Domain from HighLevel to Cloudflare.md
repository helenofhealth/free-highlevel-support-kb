### **Step 2: Obtain the Account ID and Share with Us**

* Once you have completed all above process, obtain the **account ID** of your Cloudflare account and share it with us.
* To obtain the account ID, follow this process:  
Extract the alphanumeric value from the URL.  
**Example:** In this case, this is the account ID:  
`0d2031c4bcda5980204101c44294740c![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155047811298/original/oMjuqfLL-RnS88Jn6KXRnqiizk-decNQEg.jpeg?1749127750)`

## **Transfer**

Once all 2 steps above are completed, we will initiate the transfer process from our end. You can expect the transfer to get completed within **24 hours** after we initiate it. Then you need to approve the transfer by following these steps:

  
* Go to 'Manage Domains' under 'Domain Registration' in the left navigation menu and click on 'Manage' button for the given domain.![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155047811301/original/MVf7yWRDJHpfzgtEVS06FY-hgt7whLtJ6g.jpeg?1749127750)

* You can expect the transfer to get completed within 24 hours after you accept it. Once transfer is successful, status will turn to 'Active' for that domain under 'Manage Domains'. If you find 'Invalid Nameserver' status in 'Account Home' for that domain, please wait for a few hours and then check again.![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155047811296/original/za0Cq3HD6jSmVEm7MaQFIXh3JLb-if94SA.jpeg?1749127749)

# ⚠️ Note: “Invalid Nameservers” Status

After the transfer has been accepted, the domain may temporarily show **“Invalid Nameservers”** in the **Account Home** section **Don’t worry** \- this is expected behavior.

This warning typically resolves itself **automatically within 24 hours** post-transfer. No action is needed from your side.
