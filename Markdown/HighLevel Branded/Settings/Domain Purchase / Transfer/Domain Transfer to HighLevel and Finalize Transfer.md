## **Overview**

The Finalize Transfer step is where you complete the authorization process to move your domain from your current registrar (like GoDaddy, Namecheap, IONOS, etc.) to HighLevel. This step ensures that your domain and related services continue working smoothly after the transfer.

## Unlock Domain & Get Authorization Code

Before transferring your domain, it must be unlocked, and you’ll need an authorization code (also called an EPP or transfer code) from your current registrar.

### General Instructions:

1. Log in to your current registrar account (e.g., GoDaddy, Namecheap, IONOS).
2. Go to your domain management or domain settings section.
3. Look for the Domain Lock or Registrar Lock option.
4. Disable or turn off the lock to unlock the domain.
5. Once unlocked, locate the option to get the authorization code (may be labeled EPP code, Transfer Code, or AuthInfo).
6. The code may either be displayed on screen or sent to your registered email.

## Transfer Processing & Payment

## FAQS

1\. How long does it take after I finalize the transfer?

Once submitted, transfers typically complete within 1-5 days depending on your registrar. Some domains may complete faster if approved manually.

  
2\. I don’t see the option to unlock my domain. What should I do?

Some registrars hide this setting under “Security” or “Transfer Settings.” If it’s not visible, search their help center or contact their support.

  
3\. What if my auth code is wrong?

You’ll see an error. Double-check with your registrar and make sure the domain is also unlocked.

  
4\. Will transferring my domain cause downtime?

Not if DNS records are accurately reviewed and migrated before the transfer. Always cross-check.
