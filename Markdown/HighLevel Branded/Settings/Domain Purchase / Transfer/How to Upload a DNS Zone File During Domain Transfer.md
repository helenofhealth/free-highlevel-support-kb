## **Overview**

When transferring your domain, it's critical to ensure that your DNS records are preserved. One of the most accurate ways to do this is by **uploading a DNS Zone File** exported from your current registrar.

This file contains all your domainâ€™s DNS entries including A, CNAME, TXT, MX, and other record types which are essential for keeping your website, email, and other services running smoothly after the transfer.
