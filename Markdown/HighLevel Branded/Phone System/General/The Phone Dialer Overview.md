# **What Is the Phone Dialer?**

  
HighLevel’s Phone Dialer is an enhanced browser-based calling interface designed for reliability and speed. It centralizes all call-related activities—dialing, transfers, logging notes, tagging contacts, and navigating IVR prompts—into one cohesive tool. By integrating these capabilities, the Phone Dialer minimizes clicks and automates routine tasks, allowing users to focus on conversations rather than platform mechanics.

  
## **Key Benefits of the Phone Dialer**

  
HighLevel’s dialer empowers teams with features that optimize call management and follow-up.

* **Efficient Call Transfer**: Transfer incoming and outgoing calls seamlessly without switching screens.
* **Immediate Dialing**: Open the dialer and begin entering a number without delay for rapid connections.
* **Real-Time Contact Lookup**: As you enter digits, the system auto-suggests matching contacts for quick selection.
* **One-Tap Access**: Reach your Contacts list and Recent Calls from within the dialer interface with a single click.
* **Comprehensive Call Logging**: Add detailed notes and tags after each call to capture critical insights and categorize interactions.
* **Full IVR Navigation**: Use the dialpad during calls to send DTMF tones, enabling menu-based systems to be navigated inline.

  
## **Transfer Incoming Calls**

  
Incoming-call transfers are now as straightforward as transferring outbound calls. Whether you need to escalate a conversation or redirect a customer, the Phone Dialer handles it with minimal effort.

  
HighLevel automatically preserves call context when you initiate a transfer, so notes and tags remain linked to the correct contact record.

## **Instant Dialing and Contact Search**

  
Starting calls has never been faster—clicking the dialer icon immediately opens the keypad and places the cursor in the number field. As you type, HighLevel searches your database and offers contact suggestions in real time.

  
This feature reduces the friction of switching between screens and searching manually, letting you connect faster and keep calls flowing.
  
  
## **Accessing Contacts and Recent Calls**

  
With dedicated tabs for Contacts and Recent Calls, the Phone Dialer puts your call history and address book at your fingertips. Simply tap the respective icon to toggle views without leaving the dialing interface.

  
Contextual filters help you sort by call date, contact name, or tag, making follow-ups and callbacks intuitive and well-organized.
  
  
## **Post-Call Notes and Tags**

  
Capturing call details is critical for effective follow-up. After a call ends, the Recents screen prompts you to add notes and assign tags—enabling better segmentation and reporting of customer interactions.

  
Live note-taking during calls will be available in future releases, ensuring you can log information on the spot.
  
  
## **Dialpad Navigation for IVR**

  
Automated phone menus can slow down interactions. The Phone Dialer integrates full dialpad support into live calls, allowing you to send DTMF tones directly through the interface. Press the dialpad icons or use your keyboard to navigate IVR prompts without leaving the call window.

  
This inline navigation speeds up call handling and prevents dropped connections when interacting with IVR systems.
  
  
## **How To Setup the Phone Dialer**

1. Navigate to **Settings** \> **Phone System** in HighLevel.
2. Enable the dialer under the Dialer Settings section.
