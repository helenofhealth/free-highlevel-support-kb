## **Understanding Default Preferences** 

  
### **1\. Automatically Link Phone System**

  
âœ… Pre-enabled by default

  
This setting ensures that new sub-accounts are automatically connected to the phone system. It provides instant access to messaging and voice services, eliminating the need for manual setup.

  
### **2\. Allow Sub-Account Users to Submit A2P Registration if Re-Billing is Disabled**

  
By default, sub-accounts can only submit A2P (Application-to-Person) registration if re-billing is enabled. Enabling this option allows users to submit A2P registration even when re-billing is disabled. (Optional setting)

  
### **3\. Automatically Enable Number Intelligence**

  
This feature provides enhanced phone number intelligence by:  
  
* Validating numbers before sending the first SMS
* Detecting incoming spam calls
* Looking up the names of unknown callers before answering

  
Enabling this setting improves the efficiency and reliability of phone communication. (Optional setting)

  
### **4\. Messaging Limit**

  
The **Messaging Limit** applies to all newly created sub-accounts. The selected limit determines the messaging capacity for new sub-accounts, ensuring compliance with usage policies.

  
* **Current Limit:** Messaging Ramp (default setting)
* Users can modify this setting as needed.
