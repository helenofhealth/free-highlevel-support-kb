## **Steps to Request a Twilio Number That’s Not Available-**  
  
**Step 1: Request a Twilio number that is not available:**

  
Twilio supports phone numbers in various countries around the world. You can check which countries are available here: [Twilio International Phone Number Availability](https://support.twilio.com/hc/en-us/articles/223183068-Twilio-international-phone-number-availability-and-their-capabilities).
  
  
[](https://support.twilio.com/hc/en-us/articles/223183068-Twilio-international-phone-number-availability-and-their-capabilities)If the phone number you need is not listed as available in the HighLevel platform, don’t worry, there are still ways to request the number.

  
**Step 2: If the country you want is on the list but not on Highlevel, you can buy the number through the private offering form:**

  
If the country you want is supported by Twilio but not available through HighLevel, you can buy the number directly from the Twilio console. Here’s how:

* If you are using **LC Phone System**, reach out to **[Highlevel support](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/tickets/new)** for assistance before proceeding or filling out this form.
* If you are using **Twilio** and the number isn’t available in the console, you can submit a [Private Offering Form](https://twlo.my.salesforce-sites.com/PrivateOffering) or [request a ticket with Twilio support](https://support.twilio.com/hc/en-us).[](https://twlo.my.salesforce-sites.com/PrivateOffering)[](https://support.twilio.com/hc/en-us)

**Private offerings Example:**

  
Let’s say you need a phone number from **Norway**, but Twilio doesn't have these numbers in stock. They can place an order with their Inventory Team. Here’s what to expect for different types of numbers:

* **Norway Mobile SMS** – $12/month – Expected delivery: 1-2 weeks
* **Norway Toll-Free Voice** – $25/month – Expected delivery: 2-4 weeks
* **Norway Local Voice** – $3/month – Expected delivery: 2-3 weeks

To request a number through a private offering, you will need to provide the following:

1. The **SID** of the account to associate with the number.
2. The **SID** of the bundle to associate with the number.
3. The **SID** of the address to associate with the number.
4. The **required prefix** for the number (if you have a specific one in mind).
5. The **quantity** and **type** of phone numbers you need.

For help finding your **Bundle SID** or **Address SID**, refer to the guides on [How to find a BU SID or an AD SID](https://www.twilio.com/docs/phone-numbers/regulatory/getting-started/how-find-bu-sid-or-ad-sid)

If you're requesting numbers with **regulatory compliance**, check out [How to submit a regulatory bundle for Phone Number Regulatory Compliance](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/48000981437-purchase-twilio-number-please-select-address-to-purchase-number-)

Here is also more information on Norway Regulatory Requirements. 

Twilio support generally reviews the submission within 3 business days. Once your documents have passed review, let them know so they can place an order for you for the phone number.
