## **Can't Find a Number with Your Desired Area Code?**

  
### **1\. Why This Happens-**

  
| Cause                      | Explanation                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Limited Inventory**      | HighLevel sources phone numbers via **Twilio**, and Twilio’s inventory of available numbers changes regularly.If no numbers are currently available in your selected area code, it will not appear as an option.  |
| **High-Demand Area Codes** | Some area codes, especially in **highly populated or legacy regions**, may have limited or no availability due to demand.This is common in areas like New York (212), Los Angeles (310), and San Francisco (415). |

  
### **2\. Workarounds and Solutions-**

  
1. **Try Nearby Area Codes:** Search for nearby or overlay area codes (e.g., if 310 is unavailable, try 424 in Los Angeles).
2. **Use Toll-Free or National Numbers:** If local presence isn’t critical, consider a toll-free (e.g., 888, 877) or national number, which often have more availability.
3. ****Contact HighLevel Support to request availability or notification**

  
**Note- If you don't find any international number to purchase, follow this guide- [How to request a number that is not available](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/48001231625-how-to-request-a-number-that-s-not-available-)**
