# **What is Toll-Free Number Verification?**

  
Toll-free numbers (e.g., starting with 800, 888, 877, etc.) are commonly used by businesses to send and receive messages. Verification is the process of **registering your toll-free number and business use case with carriers** to ensure you are a legitimate sender. This prevents spam and enables consistent delivery of your messages.

  
Verification is **required for sending messages from Toll-Free phone numbers to the US and Canada**. Users who don't verify will be **blocked from sending any messages** from the beginning on November 8, 2023\. We recommend all users submit their registration as soon as possible to avoid delays in processing, and verification.

## **Opt-In Methods**

  
### **1\. Verbal Opt-In**

Below is an example of a verbal opt-in, which would happen during a phone call with the consumer. You can also get a verbal opt-in by using a phone IVR flow, which would consist of an automated system getting opt-in confirmation from the consumer.

  
* **Phone IVR:** "As part of our service we can send you automated monthly text alerts regarding account payment activity. We will send two messages per month. Message and data rates may apply, depending on your mobile phone service plan. At any time you can get more help by replying HELP to these texts, or you can opt-out completely by replying STOP. Mobile Terms of Service are available at http://ghl.com/terms and our Privacy Statement can be found at https://ghl.com/privacy. Please reply with 'yes' or 'no' to indicate if you would like this service".  
    
**Customer:** "Yes please"  
    
**Phone IVR:** "Great! We will send you a text message to confirm your enrollment here shortly."
  
  
### **2\. Web Form Opt-In**

An embedded form on the end business’s website prompts end-users to enter their mobile phone number and opt into the texting campaign.
  
  
#### **⚠️ Important Requirements for Web Form Opt-In:**

1. Opt-in checkbox **MUST** be selectable by end-user
2. Opt-in checkbox **MUST**include a disclaimer (consent message) such as:  
   * _"I consent to receive sms notifications, alert from COMPANY NAME HERE. Message frequency varies. Message & data rates may apply. Text HELP to (XXX) XXX-XXX for assistance. You can reply STOP to unsubscribe at any time."_
3. Opt-in consent message and checkbox **MUST** be separated from **Privacy Policy | Terms of Service** and **Promotional** consent checkboxes. Promotional consent may be something like the following:  
   * _"By checking this box I agree to receive occasional marketing messages from INSERT COMPANY NAME HERE."_
4. Opt-in disclaimer **MUST** have All CTA disclosures present to be considered compliant:  
    
   * Program name and/or a description of the messages that will be sent (appointment reminders, marketing messages, occasional offers, etc.)  
   * Organization or individual being represented in the initial message  
   * Fee disclosure (“Message and data rates may apply”)  
   * Service delivery frequency or recurring messages disclosure (“4 messages per month”, “Message frequency varies”, “1 message per login”, etc  
   * Customer care information (typically “Text HELP for help” or Help at XXX-XXX-XXXX) - not required for single message programs (i.e 2FA)  
   * Opt out instructions (typically “Text STOP to unsubscribe”) - not required for single message programs (i.e 2FA)  
   * Link to Privacy Policy describing how end user opt-in information will be used. Be sure there is no mention of sharing of personal information with Third Parties (Must not be part of the checkbox statement. Instead, provide the link at the bottom of the form)  
   * Link to Terms and Conditions describing terms of service (Must not be part of the checkbox statement. Instead, provide the link at the bottom of the form)  
   * Incorporate a checkbox option that end-users must select in order to receive SMS messaging. **The checkbox can not be pre-selected.** The checkbox provides the end-user the ability to agree, or not agree, to receive SMS messaging.

**Below are examples of Web form Opt-In flow.**

  
When **Phone Number** field is **Mandatory** in Web form OPT-IN.

* Consent checkboxes should be separated for both Marketing and Non-Marketing Messages.
* Consent **checkboxes cannot be pre-selected** and **should be optional** when **Phone Number is required.**
* SMS notifications cannot be forced in the form. Meaning **you cannot require BOTH consent and the phone number to proceed.**
* **Privacy Policy** and **TnC** at footer.

**PLEASE NOTE:**

If the web opt-in is behind a login or not yet published, host a screen shot on a publicly accessible website (like OneDrive or Google Drive) and provide the image URL and the website URL in your registration form where it asks: **"How do end-users consent to receive messages?"**  
  
To get a useable image link, you can upload the screenshot to your **Media Storage Library** in your **HighLevel sub-account** as shown in the screenshot below:

**![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155047335619/original/xrZpFagO43nXYYOMaUWrRsGgdtqCriL-bA.png?1748418112)**

  
### **3\. Paper Form Opt-In**

An in-store visitor completes a physical form that collects their phone number and their consent to subscribe to your texting campaign.

Host a screenshot of the paper form on a publicly accessible website (like OneDrive or Google Drive or Subaccount's media library) and provide the URL in the answer for "How do end-users consent to receive messages?".
  
  
### **4\. Text Message Opt-In**

Host a screen shot of the campaign collateral on a publicly accessible website (like OneDrive or Google Drive or Subaccount's media library) and provide the URL in the answer for "How do end-users consent to receive messages?" along with the website URL.

  
![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155047335620/original/kY_utVS0jQMyLz0y9xMeBFsqZTe-08JusA.png?1748418112)
  
  
### **5\. Mobile QR Code Opt-In**

You can also use a QR code that links to an online form prompting end-users to enter their mobile phone number and opt into the texting campaign.

  
QR codes can direct the consumer to the messaging application used on their mobile device (for example iMessage) with a templated opt-in message, or can even take the consumer directly to a web-form opt-in on your website.

  
**PLEASE NOTE:** If the QR code leads to a Web-Form Opt-In, please follow all requirements listed in this article above where we discuss the Web-Form Opt-In method.
  
  
**Note:** The opt-in method **must match the submitted Use Case**. For example, marketing campaigns require express consent where the user actively agrees to receive messages.  
  
**Live Website Required:** 
  
✅ Must be operational and include a clear opt-in for messaging.  
  
✅ Include Terms of Service and Privacy Policy links in the footer of all pages.

* #### Choose **Use Case Category/Categories** that your business will message users for.  
    
   * Choose the category that best represents **how the number will be used**.  
   * Must reflect the **actual messaging pattern** tied to this toll-free number.  
         
   **Note**: Ensure that the 'Marketing' checkbox is selected along with any other applicable use cases if marketing activities are involved. If 'Marketing' is not selected in the opt-in form or the use case does not reflect marketing, verification may fail.![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155048688917/original/Dh--Cn35xXFZ6LevYF7ZwK_3-TfyeR90Jw.png?1750665225)
* #### Enter **Opt-In Workflow Image URLs**.  
    
   * Clearly outline **how the user gives consent** (Opt-In Type).  
   * A **visual proof** (image, screenshot, or document) that matches the **selected Opt-In Type**.  
         
         * The visual must clearly show **where and how** the user provides their phone number and agrees to receive messages.  
         * The URL or file must be **publicly accessible** (not behind a login or private folder)  
   * **Approved Examples:**  
         
   <https://storage.googleapis.com/msgsndr/RNTEDRA9ap9xSh2MyTYS/media/65271336fe7786badd88b169.png>
* #### Add **Use Case Descriptions**.  
    
   * Provide a **detailed explanation** of how messaging is used.  
   * The more specific, the better — include:  
         
         * Purpose of messaging  
         * Target audience  
         * Opt-in methods  
         * Platforms used (POS, web forms, chat, etc.)  
         * ✅ **Approved Example:**  
                 
         "This number is used to send promotional offers to customers of John’s Coffee Shop who have opted in through our website or POS system."  
         * ❌ **Rejected Example:**  
                 
         "Marketing" – too vague and not tied to specific content or opt-in method.
* #### Add **Message Content**.  
    
   * Provide sample messages that match the use case. Must include:  
         
         * A clear message  
         * Personalization (if applicable)  
         * Business name  
         * Opt-out language ("Reply STOP to opt out")  
         * ✅ **Approved Example:**  
                 
         "Thank you for being a loyal customer of John’s Coffee Shop. Enjoy 10% off your next purchase. Reply STOP to opt out."  
         * ❌ **Rejected Example:**  
                 
         "Your appointment is today at 10:00 AM" – lacks business name, opt-out language, and context.

## **Monitor Verification Status**

  
Phone Number registrations can take up to **4 to 6 weeks to complete.** However, we have seen Toll-Free Numbers approval in as little as two days (though we cannot guarantee any timeline for approval).

  
Once you submit your verification request, you can monitor the verification status as it changes during processing through the Console. Please see below for a full overview of each status:

| ****TFPN Traffic**           | ****Traffic limits**          | ****What's happening?**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Restricted (Un-verified)** | **Blocked**                   | **Starting on November 8, 2023, ALL Restricted traffic will be blocked in the US. To avoid this, we recommend submitting your number(s) for verification as soon as possible.** **Restricted (previously “Unverified”) status means that your Toll-Free number has not been submitted for verification or was not approved.**                                                                                            |
| **Verified (Approved)**      | **3 SMS segments per second** | **Upon a successful review of your verification submission and carrier approval, your number(s) will be moved to "Verified" status. Verified numbers have full access to A2P sending, and a greatly reduced risk for message filtering on Toll-Free traffic toward all major networks in the US and Canada, as long as you adhere to your stated use case and all applicable rules, such as Twilio's Messaging Policy.** |
| **Rejected**                 | **Blocked**                   | **A rejected verification request can occur for a number of reasons and can affect your ability to send messaging traffic.**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
