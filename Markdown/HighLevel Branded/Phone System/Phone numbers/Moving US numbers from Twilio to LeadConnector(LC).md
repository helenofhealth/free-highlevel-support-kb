## **Before Moving Your US Twilio Number**

  
There are a few important things to check and prepare to ensure a smooth and successful migration of your Twilio number to an LC Phone sub-account. This section outlines the necessary steps, access, and information you’ll need to complete the migration without issues.

  
* Access to the client’s Twilio account (must be the account owner).
* The **Location ID** of the High-Level sub-account where the number will be migrated.
* A support request was submitted to **HighLevel Support** to obtain the **Gaining Sub-account SID** (LC Phone's Twilio sub-account SID for that location).
* If the number is **international**, required **regulatory bundles and addresses** must already be approved in Twilio.

## **What Is the LC Phone System?**

  
LC Phone is HighLevel’s built-in phone system that operates via a Twilio ISV (Independent Software Vendor) connection. When you move a client’s Twilio number into their LC Phone sub-account, the number becomes fully managed inside HighLevel without needing a separate Twilio integration. This creates a more stable and feature-rich experience for users.

Yes, but each migration must be submitted separately and authorized by the original account owner.
