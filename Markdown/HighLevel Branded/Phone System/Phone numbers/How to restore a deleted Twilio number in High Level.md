Our team will check if the number is still available and attempt restoration on your behalf.

  
* **Contact HighLevel Support** directlyvia the support chat and include the **Location ID** of the sub-account where the number should be restored.
* Our support team will assist you in restoring the number internally.

## **If You're Using Your Own Twilio Account**

  
If you're using your **own Twilio account** (not LC Phone), you can attempt to restore the number directly from the Twilio Console, within 10 days of deletion. Twilio temporarily holds released numbers in your account under the “Released Numbers” section. You’ll need to locate the correct sub-account where the number was originally assigned and then manually repurchase it. If the number no longer appears, you’ll need to contact Twilio Support for assistance with recovery.

  
### **Step 1:** Log in to theTwilio Console

  
 Navigate to your Sub-Account, click on your account name.

### **Step 2:** Find the Twilio SID

  
If there are too many subaccounts inside Twilio, you can go back to HL and copy the Account SID for that location to search in Twilio. Go to your **Agency View** in GoHighLevel, navigate to **Settings → Phone Integration → Subaccount Settings** to find the Subaccount.
