## ? When Is Persona Required?

Persona verification is **only required** under the following conditions:

* You're purchasing a number from the **US, Canada, or Puerto Rico** (`+1` country code)
* Your **sub-account has not previously completed Persona verification**

Once verified, users **will not be asked to complete Persona again** for that sub-account—this applies to future:

* Phone Number Purchases
* A2P Brand Registrations
* Toll-Free Number Verifications
* CNAM Setups
* SHAKEN/STIR Authentication
