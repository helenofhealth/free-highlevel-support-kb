## **Phone Number Configuration Options Explained**

  
### **1\. Name Your Number**

  
* This option lets you **label your number for internal reference**.
* **Example:** Main Sales Line, Support Line, or Agent John's Number.

  
![](https://jumpshare.com/v/9Zu6gYwawV1NhB6sbQ2q+/Screen+Shot+2025-06-10+at+1.21.48+AM.png)   **Name your Number**

  
### **2\. Pass Called Number As Caller ID**

  
* By default, the **system transmits the number of the caller for caller ID**. However, if you prefer your caller ID to **show the number that the caller dialed instead**, you can activate this feature.
* This is most relevant if the caller dialed number A and was forwarded to number B (your number).

### **3\. Forward Calls To**

  
* Lets you define the number where **incoming calls will be routed to**. Useful for forwarding to mobile phones, external lines, or different departments.
* When a caller **dials Number A (the configured number)**, the call is **immediately forwarded to Number B (the destination number)**.

  
![](https://jumpshare.com/v/I4ISKXhuyNxObH2K89Uf+/Screen+Shot+2025-06-10+at+1.25.58+AM.png)   **Forward calls to**

  
### **4\. Use Your Verified Number as Caller ID for Outbound Calls**

  
* This feature allows you to **show your verified phone number in the callerID of the recipient** when you are making outbound phone calls.

  
**Note:** This option is **only applicable to Verified Phone Numbers**.

###   

  
### **5\. Call Connect**

  
* When enabled, the **recipient will hear a whisper message prompting them to press a key to accept the call**, ensuring that **only calls answered by a human are marked as connected**.
* Ideal for:
1. Enabling Missed-Call Text-Back automations.
2. Preventing voicemails from being falsely marked as successful calls.

![](https://jumpshare.com/v/zfuqjKMaC9hfdKPP462J+/Screen+Shot+2025-06-10+at+1.29.18+AM.png) **Enable call connect feature**

  
### **6\. Whisper Message**

  
* This option allows you to set the **message that plays before connecting the call** when **Call Connect is enabled**.
* **Example:** “Call from HighLevel - press a key to connect.” or "Call from XYZ Agency - press a key to connect."

  
![](https://jumpshare.com/v/FunUPAMfaUmh1saB10k8+/Screen+Shot+2025-06-10+at+1.31.15+AM.png)   **Whisper message**

  
### **7\. Call Recording and Play Call Recording Message**

  
* The **Call Recording** option enables **automatic call recordings for training, quality assurance, or compliance purposes**.
* The **Play Call Recording Message** setting lets you **add a pre-recording whisper message,** such as “This call will be recorded for quality purposes,” to inform the receiver before recording begins.

  
**Important:** Call Recording costs **$0.0025/min**. Storing it costs **$0.0005/min/month**.  
  
  
**Note:** In many U.S. states, playing a **recording disclaimer is legally required** to ensure compliance.

### **8\.** **Incoming Call Timeout**

  
* The amount of **time (in seconds) the system lets the inbound call ring before being dropped or forwarded to a voicemail** (personal voicemail or pre-recorded voicemail within the CRM).

  
**A) Scenario 1:** Route to Personal Voicemail

  
If you want missed calls to go to your **cellphone's voicemail**, simply leave the Inbound Call Timeout field **blank** or **set it to 60 seconds**. This gives the call enough time to reach your personal voicemail system.

###   

**B) Scenario 2:** Route to CRM Voicemail After Ringing

  
If you'd like the call to ring briefly before directing the lead to a **pre-recorded voicemail within the CRM**, set the Inbound Call Timeout to **around 20 seconds**. This avoids the call reaching your personal voicemail and ensures it gets handled by your CRM setup.

  
**C) Scenario 3:** Direct to CRM Voicemail Immediately

  
To send calls **directly to a pre-recorded CRM voicemail** without ringing your phone, set the Inbound Call Timeout to **1–4 seconds**.

  
**Note:** Make sure you’ve uploaded a voicemail recording (**MP3 or WAV format**) either in the **Business Info tab** or in the **assigned user’s profile settings**.

### **9.** **Outgoing Call Timeout**

  
* The amount of **time (in seconds) the system lets the outbound call ring** **before dropping the call**.
* Use a shorter timeout like **30 seconds** to **avoid hitting customer voicemails,** ideal for voicemail-drop or lead-churn reduction campaigns.

  
![](https://jumpshare.com/v/GnRz3bmvUp90jfhxYIVE+/Screen+Shot+2025-06-10+at+1.35.51+AM.png) **Outgoing call timeout**

  
### **10\. Ring Incoming Calls to Selected Users**

  
* This feature allows you to **route incoming calls to multiple users (team members) within your sub-account**.
* When a call comes in, the **phones of all selected users will ring simultaneously until someone answers or the call times out**.
* You can assign **maximum 7 users** to receive these calls, helping ensure that important calls are answered promptly, even if some team members are unavailable at the time.
