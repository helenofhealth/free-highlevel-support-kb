## **Voice Integrity with High Level**

  
Legitimate calls shouldn’t be mistaken for spam. With HighLevel’s Voice Integrity, you can register your U.S. phone numbers with the leading caller-ID analytics firms (First Orion, Hiya, TNS) to remove “spam likely” labels, repair a troubled reputation, and boost your answer rates, especially for numbers that have been blocked or flagged in the past.

## **Why Switch on Voice Integrity?**

  
* **Fix a bad reputation:** Clear existing spam flags and restore trust in your caller ID.
* **Higher answer rates:** Studies show calls labeled with a recognized, branded name are far more likely to be answered.
* **Better deliverability:** Legitimate callers avoid unnecessary blocks, so your outreach and support calls reach more customers.

## **Before Registering for Voice Integrity**

  
Before you enable Voice Integrity, make sure you’ve met the following key requirements.

  
1. **SHAKEN/STIR Registration** (required)  
To prove each outgoing call is authentic, you must have a valid SHAKEN/STIR attestation on your account.
2. **CNAM (Caller Name)** (recommended)  
Submitting a branded name alongside your number further enhances trust in analytics platforms.
3. **U.S. Phone Numbers Only**  
Voice Integrity currently applies solely to domestic traffic—international numbers are not supported.

## **Enabling Voice Integrity**

  
Here’s how to activate Voice Integrity in minutes and ensure your calls are marked as legitimate across the major networks. Also, please note that SHAKEN/STIR registration is required to complete the Voice Integrity form. If you don’t already have it, register before proceeding.

  
### **Step 1:** Navigate to the Voice Integrity Tab within the Trust Center

## **What Happens After You Register?**

  
Once you submit your information, each of the analytics providers—Hiya, TNS, and First Orion—will review your registration separately.

  
* **Fast Turnaround:** Most applications clear within two business days.
* **Live Updates:** You’ll receive a notification once your numbers are approved.
* Label removal may take time to propagate across all networks

**Please Note:** To get started with Voice Integrity, your business must first be registered for SHAKEN/STIR, which requires a valid Employer Identification Number (EIN). However, if you're a sole proprietor or do not yet have an EIN, you can still improve your phone number reputation using the Free Caller Registry.

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

  
**Q: Will activating Voice Integrity automatically enroll my numbers in SHAKEN/STIR?**  
No. SHAKEN/STIR must be fully configured on your account before you can register for Voice Integrity.
  
  
**Q: Can I register international numbers?**  
At this time, only U.S. numbers are supported. We’re evaluating expansion to other regions.
  
  
**Q: Why is CNAM optional?**  
SHAKEN/STIR is the core requirement for proving call authenticity. Adding a branded CNAM record is recommended to maximize trust and answer rates, but not strictly mandatory.
