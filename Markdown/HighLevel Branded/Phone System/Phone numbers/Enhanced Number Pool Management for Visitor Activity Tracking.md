## **Audit Logging**

  
Audit logging records every action taken within number pools, providing a transparent history for compliance and troubleshooting.

* Track who moved, removed, or deleted numbers.
* Review timestamps and details for each action.
* Use logs to resolve disputes or investigate issues.

---

## **Best Practices for Number Pool Organization**

  
Organizing your number pools effectively supports accurate visitor tracking and campaign analysis.

* Group numbers by campaign, region, or use case for clarity.
* Regularly review and clean up unused numbers to maintain efficiency.
* Use descriptive pool names for easy identification.

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

  
**Q: Can I restore a deleted number to a pool?**

Once a number is deleted, it cannot be restored. Only numbers removed (not deleted) can be reassigned.

  
**Q: Is there a limit to how many times I can move a number between pools?**

No, you can move numbers between pools as often as needed.

  
**Q: Will removing a number from a pool affect my tracking data?**

Removing a number only changes its pool assignment; it does not delete historical tracking data.

  
**Q: How do I know who made changes to a number pool?**

All actions are recorded in the audit log, including the user, action, and timestamp.

  
**Q: What happens if I delete a pool?**

Deleting a pool removes all numbers within it. To keep numbers, move or remove them before deleting the pool.
