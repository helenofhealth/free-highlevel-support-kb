## **Step 1\. Delete and Re-create the contact**

  
The new contacts will be using the new default Twilio number.

  
## **Step 2\. Remove the old default Twilio number**

  
We could remove the old Twilio phone number. That way all SMS will be sent from the new Twilio number bought.

  
## **Step 3\. Assign the new default Twilio number to the user, assign the user to the contact and log in as the user to send an SMS**

  
If you want to keep the old Twilio phone number, another suggestion would be to assign the new Twilio phone number to the user and log in as the user to send those SMS. You could also assign the user in the Workflow action. That way all automated SMS will be sent from the new Twilio number bought.
