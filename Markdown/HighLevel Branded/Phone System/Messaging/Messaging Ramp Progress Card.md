## **Step-by-Step Guidance**

Helpful tooltips and a modal guide walk you through how to progress:

Send Current Limit: Max out your daily limit to trigger eligibility for the next level.

Temporary Block Notification: Hitting the daily cap will result in a 24-hour temporary pause—a normal part of the ramp-up process.

Unlocking New Levels: Once requirements are met, your SMS limit increases automatically. The card updates to reflect your new level and what’s next.
