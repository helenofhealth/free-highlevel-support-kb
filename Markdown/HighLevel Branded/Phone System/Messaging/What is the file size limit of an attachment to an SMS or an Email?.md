## **SMS Attachment Size Limits**

  
SMS messages can only contain text. To include attachments like images, videos, or audio files, you must use MMS, which is supported differently depending on the phone number type and carrier. If you're attaching a file to an SMS, it is automatically converted to an MMS. The following file types are supported for MMS:

  
* JPEG
* PNG
* GIF

**Please Note:** Some file types like MP3, MP4, and PDF may work depending on the carrier and device.You can also check out Twilio’s list of supported media types here: [Twilio Supported File Types](https://help.twilio.com/articles/223181188)

###   

  
### **1\. Carrier-Specific File Size Limits for MMS**

  
The Recommended Best Practice is to keep MMS attachments under 500 KB to ensure successful delivery across all carriers.

  
| Carrier  | Max File Size (MMS) |
| -------- | ------------------- |
| AT&T     | 600 KB              |
| Verizon  | 600 KB              |
| T-Mobile | 1.5 MB              |
| Sprint   | 1.4 MB              |
  
  
### **2\. Short Code, Toll-Free, and Long Code Support for MMS**

  
As of **October 2022**, **Toll-Free numbers support MMS**. Before that, they supported SMS only.

  
| Message Type      | Supports MMS?            | Recommended Max Size |
| ----------------- | ------------------------ | -------------------- |
| Long Code (10DLC) | ✅ Yes                    | \~500 KB – 1 MB      |
| Short Code        | ✅ Yes                    | Up to 5 MB           |
| Toll-Free         | ✅ Yes _(Since Oct 2022)_ | Up to 5 MB           |

## **Email Attachment Size Limits**

  
Attachment limits for email depend on the email provider used. Exceeding these limits can cause emails to bounce or be undeliverable.

###   

### **File Size Limits by Provider**

  
The HighLevel email composer allows **up to 20 MB** in attachments. Files above this size will be automatically uploaded to the **Media Library** and sent as clickable links.

  
| Email Provider | Max Attachment Size |
| -------------- | ------------------- |
| Gmail          | 25 MB               |
| Yahoo Mail     | 25 MB               |
| Outlook.com    | 10 MB               |
| Mailgun        | 25 MB               |

## **How to Upload Attachments in Conversations**

  
Uploading files directly in the Conversations composer has been made easier and more flexible with the new attachment workflow. Whether you're sending an SMS or an email, you can now upload files from your device or choose from your Media Library — all from within the message composer. This process eliminates the need to manually compress files or use third-party hosting platforms, streamlining your workflow and improving the customer experience. Here is a Step-by-Step process for uploading or attaching Files.

  
#### 1\. **Access the Attachment Options**

  
To begin, open a conversation under the conversations tab and click the **three-dot icon (•••)** in the message composer.

#### 2\. **Choose Your Attachment Source**

  
After clicking on the three dot icon, select **“Attach Files”**. You'll see two options:

* **Upload from System** – choose a file from your local device
* **Choose from Media Library** – select a previously uploaded file

####   

#### 3\. **Automatic Handling for Large Files**

  
* If the file exceeds **20MB (for email)** or **any size for SMS**, HighLevel will automatically upload it to the **Media Library** and insert a **clickable link** into your message.
* This ensures that your message is delivered without hitting size limits.

  
**IMPORTANT**: **Video Uploads Get Auto-Generated Thumbnails** When uploading a video file through the Media Library, HighLevel will automatically generate a **GIF thumbnail** to be shown in your email, making your message more engaging and clickable.

## **How to Send Larger Files**

  
* Upload directly via the email/SMS composer.
* Files larger than 20MB are auto-hosted via Media Library and inserted as links.
* Use cloud hosting only if needed outside HighLevel.
* Add videos via Media Library for interactive thumbnails.
