The following are the most frequently encountered SMS errors within HighLevel:  
  
### **1\. Error 11751** – Media Message Size Limit Exceeded

  
**Description:** The total size of the media message exceeds the maximum limit allowed by the messaging provider.  
  
**Resolution:**

* Compress or resize the media file.
* Ensure the file stays within Twilio’s supported MMS size limits.

  
### **2\. Error 21610** – User Opted Out

  
**Description:** The recipient has opted out of receiving messages by replying with STOP.  

  
**Resolution:**  
  
* Do not message this number again unless the user sends START to opt back in.
* Ensure proper opt-in mechanisms are in place.

###   

### **3\. Error 21612** – Unreachable 'To' Number from Current Sender

  
**Description:** The recipient number can’t be reached using the current ‘From’ number (e.g., due to carrier restrictions or unsupported international routes).  
  
**Resolution:**  
  
* Use a local or internationally enabled number.
* Confirm routing compatibility between ‘To’ and ‘From’ numbers.

  
### **4\. Error 30002** – Account Suspended Before Delivery

  
**Description:** Your Twilio account was suspended between the time of message send and delivery.  

  
**Resolution:**

  
* Contact Twilio Support to resolve account status.
* Ensure your account remains active for message queues.

  
### **5\. Error 30003** – Unavailable or Inactive Number

  
**Description:** The recipient's phone is turned off, out of range, or temporarily unavailable.  
  
**Resolution:**

  
* Retry the message later.
* Verify the number is active.

  
### **6\. Error 30004** – Message Blocked by Carrier

  
**Description:** The destination number is blocked from receiving this message.

  
**Resolution:**

  
* Confirm the number is valid and not carrier-blocked.
* Avoid messaging numbers with prior failed delivery history.

  
### **7\. Error 30005** – Unknown Destination Handset

  
**Description:** The destination device is unreachable (e.g., turned off or out of range for extended period).

  
**Resolution:**

  
* Retry after some time.
* Clean your list to remove unreachable or inactive numbers.

  
### **8\. Error 30006** – Landline or Unsupported Number

  
**Description:** The number cannot receive SMS—usually because it’s a landline or incompatible with SMS.

  
**Resolution:**  
  
* Remove landlines from your list using number validation tools.
* Confirm numbers support SMS before messaging.

  
### **9\. Error 30007** – Carrier Filtering (Spam or Policy Violation)

  
**Description:** The message was blocked by the carrier for violating content policies or appearing as spam.

  
**Resolution:**

  
* Avoid spam-like content and shortened URLs.
* Use personalized, compliant messaging.
* Register your number with A2P 10DLC or Toll-Free verification.

  
### **10\. Error 30034** – US A2P 10DLC: Message from an Unregistered Number

  
**Description:** You attempted to send a message to a U.S. number from a 10DLC number that is not associated with a registered A2P campaign.

  
**Resolution:**  
  
* Register your number through Twilio's Trust Hub.
* Link the number to an approved Messaging Service.
* Confirm proper campaign association.

  
### **11\. Error 30008** – Unknown Error

  
**Description:** An unspecified error occurred during message delivery.

  
**Resolution:**  
  
* Check the message body for formatting or content issues.
* Test with a different number or content structure.

  
### **12\. Error 11200** – HTTP retrieval failure

  
**Description:** This error often occurs when images fail to load or send in conversations.

  
**Resolution:**  
  
* Check the domain’s DNS configuration using MXToolbox. If the DNS records aren’t found or not pointing to brand.ludicrous.cloud, this can cause the image retrieval to fail.
* ![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155048038110/original/DSMUXHzu7zkN9Fk7fHyrtnbxHsMZ_Py14g.png?1749592564)
* To resolve this:  
Ensure a CNAME record is set up correctly, pointing your branded domain to:  
brand.ludicrous.cloud  
    
If this is missing or misconfigured, images will appear broken in conversations. Check out [Branding System-Generated Links (API Domain)](https://help.gohighlevel.com/en/support/solutions/articles/48001143244)

* Format SMS Content Properly
* Avoid all caps, spammy phrases, or including long URLs without a proper link shortener.
* Use a conversational tone to avoid content blocks.
* Maintain Clean Lists
* Ensure numbers are valid, formatted correctly, and that users have opted in.
* Monitor Error Trends
* Use HighLevel’s reporting tools to spot patterns in delivery issues and make proactive adjustments.

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

  
**Q: How can I get a user to resubscribe after opting out?**  
The user must send a message with the word START to the same number they unsubscribed from.  
  
**Q: Can I resend messages that failed due to a 30007 error?**  
Yes, but first revise the content to comply with carrier filtering guidelines before retrying.  
  
**Q: Why do some messages fail even if the number is valid?**  
Carriers may still block messages due to content filtering or recipient settings.  
  
**Q: How can I tell if a number is a landline?**  
Use number validation tools or scrub lists before uploading to HighLevel.  
  
**Q: Will HighLevel alert me of frequent SMS errors?**
