# **What is Error 30007 – Carrier Filtering?**

  
30007 is a **carrier-side error** that indicates your message was filtered due to **content, sender identity, or compliance reasons**.

  
This happens when a message:  
  
* Violates a carrier’s messaging policy.
* Appears similar to spam or illegal traffic.
* Is missing required compliance elements, like opt-in consent or sender identification.

  
These filters are enforced to protect consumers, comply with national regulations (like A2P 10DLC in the U.S.), and maintain platform trust.

## **How to Prevent Messages from Being Filtered**

  
Below are structured guidelines based on carrier requirements, HighLevel's policies, and industry best practices.

  
### **1\. Consent and Opt-In**

  
* Only message users who’ve **explicitly opted in**.
* Your message must **identify the sender** and **include opt-out instructions**.
* You must **include STOP language at least once every 30 days** if you message the same contact regularly.
* Avoid creative variations like “**Reply 2 to unsubscribe**” – these are **non-compliant** and will be filtered.
* **Reconfirm opt-in every 18 months** to avoid accidental messaging of recycled numbers.
* **Monitor opt-out rates and complaint spikes**,carriers will begin filtering traffic that shows abuse patterns.

  
### **2\. Use Case & Sender Selection**

  
* **Avoid forbidden use cases**, such as payday loans, debt relief, cannabis, etc.  
    
Checkout our guide on - [Forbidden message categories for SMS and MMS in the US and Canada.](https://help.gohighlevel.com/en/support/solutions/articles/48001219617)
* Do not “**snowshoe**” across multiple numbers to evade filtering – use numbers based on geography or business units only.
* Use pre-registered short codes or Alphanumeric Sender IDs where required, especially for countries like France.
* Refer to **SMS Guidelines by Country** for local rules.

  
### **3\. Message Content & Formatting**

  
* Avoid public **URL shorteners** (like Bitly, TinyURL). **U** **se branded domains** like (yourbusiness.com/offer).
* Never use **obfuscated links** or **suspicious redirects**.
* Use **clear, well-written language** and avoid,  
    
   1. Emojis, excessive punctuation, or CAPS.  
   2. Misspellings or poor grammar.
* Do not send **illegal** or **misleading** **content**, or anything listed in the Forbidden Categories link above.

  
### **4\. Opt-Out & Compliance Requirements**

  
Your SMS must:

  
* Contain **STOP** instructions (at least monthly).
* Clearly **name the sender**.
* Be sent only to users who gave explicit permission.

  
### **5\. Monitoring & DND Handling**

  
* Process **DND (Do Not Disturb) requests daily** – deactivated numbers are no longer valid recipients.
* A message triggering 30007 can mark a contact as DND automatically.

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

  
**Q: Why does message filtering vary between carriers?** 
Each carrier uses different filtering logic and algorithms. A message blocked by one carrier (e.g., Verizon) might be delivered by another (e.g., AT&T), depending on the content, volume, and sender history.

  
**Q: What if I’m messaging international numbers?** 
Each country has different SMS rules. Some require specific sender types (e.g., short codes or alpha IDs), and others restrict certain industries.

  
**Q: How do I know if a contact was marked DND because of 30007?** 
You can check their conversation status, error logs, and delivery error codes. If they are in DND, and messages were previously filtered, it's likely related.

  
**Q: Will repeated 30007 errors block my number permanently?** 
It can lead to DND status, restriction, or even number deactivation if unresolved.

  
**Q: How can I test if my messages will be filtered?** 
There’s no test tool, but following best practices significantly reduces the risk.

  
**Q: Do I need A2P 10DLC if I only send to a small list?** 
Yes. Any U.S.-bound SMS traffic must comply with A2P 10DLC registration.

  
**Q: Can I use emojis or shortened links?** 
Best to avoid both. Use only branded URLs and standard language formatting.
