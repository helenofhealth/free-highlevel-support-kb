**Q.Will I be charged if I encounter an error when sending an SMS?**

If there's an internal error with LC Phone before the message is handed off to the phone provider, you won't be charged.

This includes messages sent from toll-free numbers, A2P numbers, and those not deliverable due to country restrictions or other factors. We urge users to be fully informed and cautious before sending messages, as refunds will not be provided for undelivered SMS.

To avoid getting charged for call recordings done earlier, you can request to delete all call recordings.
  
  
**Q. Why do I pay for Conference Call charges for all outgoing calls (even the ones without call transfer)?**

Our outgoing call flow is optimised to be seamless, with lower waiting times and quicker transfers. Thus, we initiate a Conference Call for all outgoing calls as per our standard call flow implementation.
