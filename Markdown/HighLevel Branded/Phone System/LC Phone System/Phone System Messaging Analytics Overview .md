## **Frequently Asked Questions**

  
**Q: Can I download or export my analytics data?** 
Currently, exporting is not available from the Messaging Analytics UI. You can take screenshots or refer to detailed logs in the conversations tab.

  
**Q: Why don’t I see any messages listed under a campaign or workflow?**  
Ensure that messages are properly tagged with campaign or workflow IDs during creation. Also confirm that the selected date range includes the expected activity.

  
**Q: How often is the data updated in Messaging Analytics?**  
The analytics dashboard updates in near real-time, but delays may occur depending on message volume and carrier feedback.

  
**Q: What should I do if my delivery rate drops suddenly?**  
Check for recent content changes, review Error codes, and validate that your sending practices comply with the LC Messaging Policy.

  
**Q: Can I filter by phone number or contact?**  
Not currently. Messaging Analytics filters work at the campaign, workflow, bulk request, and date level only.

'Failed' refers to delivery attempts that didn’t reach recipients (e.g., invalid numbers), while 'Error' typically reflects carrier-specific rejections or system issues.
