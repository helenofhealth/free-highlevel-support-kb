## **Why was the LC-Phone System Created**

  
Understand the history and vision behind building HighLevel’s own telephony system. Before LC - Phone, agencies were required to create and configure a Twilio account in order to send SMS or make calls. This added friction during onboarding and required technical knowledge that not all users had. To resolve this challenge, we built LC-Phone, a fully integrated telephony solution that eliminates third-party complexity and ensures messaging capabilities are available right away, just like any modern SaaS platform should offer.

  
**With LC - Phone, your agency can now:**

* Skip external setup.
* Use communication tools immediately.
* Enjoy centralized billing, support, and monitoring
