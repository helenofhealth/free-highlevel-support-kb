Number pools are a great way to track the calls driven by paid campaigns. Using number pools, you can attribute call-tracking conversations based on specific phone numbers being shown to leads that land on designated landing pages and websites. These numbers(s) are only displayed on specific pages and are only shown to leads who take a specific course of action. They’re also known as “call tracking codes,” but we call them “number pools.”

  
In this article, we’ll go over how to set up number pools so you can start collecting data about your visitors.

**Please Note:**

**Update (July 29, 2020)**  
For US Numbers (10-digit local numbers), you can now put the number in any one of these three formats 111-222-3333, 111.222.3333, or (111) 222-3333, and the swap script will recognize and swap the number.

## **How To Test Number Swapping**

Once you've added the tracking script to the Body of your webpage, you can test that the number swap is working by opening an incognito browser.

  
You would enter the following into your incognito browser [yourwebsite.com/landing-page](//yourwebsite.com/landing-page?gclid) then hit enter.

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155035690960/original/MDx6s5ci7aK5J-T1I30xsRbIi4L9fdNBQA.jpeg?1730277583)

  
If the Tracking Option **All Except Direct** is selected, we must link the landing page URL from another webpage instead of entering the link directly from the browser to test.

e.g. link Apple Smiles with [yourwebsite.com/landing-page](https://yourwebsite.com/landing-page,)

## **How To Set Up Keyword Tracking**

For HighLevel to display the keyword that was searched before the call was initiated, you'll need to add the following parameter to the ad URL in Google Ads: ?keyword={keyword}

  
So if you have a Google Ad with a url like [yourwebsite.com/landingpage](https://yourwebsite.com/landingpage) you would update that url to be: [yourwebsite.com/landingpage/?keyword={keyword}](https://yourwebsite.com/landingpage/?keyword=%7Bkeyword%7D)

## **To swap numbers in a button:**

You can use an anchor tag and set href with the phone no and text as you want.

  
e.g. **<a href="tel:(972) 421-5139" class="btn btn-blue">Call Us</a>**

  
---

## **Group ID**

It will help to swap only one number but not each and every number from different number pools. So it will find the best matching number pool and swap number.
  
  
**Use-case Example:**

If the user is running two ads. If the leads land on the first ad, the website will show a different number; if they land on the second ad, the website will show another different number.  
  
Then they need to change the source according to the ad and set the group using a **Group ID.**

  
**Edit** the number pool > Click on **Add/Edit Group Id** \> Name the **group Id** \> Click **Update.**

**![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155035693322/original/aJDR2Chhn6zQKhxedMCQb32foCGt-toP-g.gif?1730278925)**

  
You can click on the information icon to copy the Group snippet to integrate it in the footer of your website:

## **FAQs**

  
### **1\. Why must we set up number pools to track calls?**

We recommend setting up call tracking for all sources. We can determine how they arrive at your website by switching the phone number as soon as leads land from different sources. For example, for real live Google ads, there are &gclid parameters at the end of the landing URL. That’s how our snippet code sees them and switches the number accordingly, so once they call that tracking number, we match up with the website cookies, link them, and attribute the source to the leads.

  
Once the website visitors call the tracking number, we can attribute keywords in the Call reporting tab. So this column keyword will be filled out with those data:

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155035685897/original/VWgv6ISZNQWwPZCNl1qo1mr0o-RNAiveBw.jpeg?1730273987)

  
### **2\. What is the cost/price for setting up a Number Pool?**

Each number in a Number Pool is billed at the same rate as a standard phone number in your account. A minimum of 4 numbers is required per pool, which means you will incur charges for each of those numbers. If you’re using LC-Twilio, standard Twilio pricing applies (e.g., $1/month per U.S. number plus usage). If your agency is on your own Twilio, pricing will depend on your Twilio account settings. Keep in mind that larger pools will cost more, so choose the pool size based on your traffic volume. You can always view or adjust phone number costs under Subaccount > Settings > Phone Numbers.

  
### **3\. Can I direct calls from the Number Pool to the web app or the mobile app?**

Currently, this is not possible. Calls made to Number Pool can only go to the 'Forward Calls to' number.
