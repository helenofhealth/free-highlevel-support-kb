# **What is the Dialer (Softphone)**

  
The in-browser web app Dialer (Softphone) is a tool you can use to make outbound calls inside your browser instead of needing to use the mobile app. It works on a desktop or a mobile browser.

## **Manage Ongoing Calls** 

  
Once a call is connected, you have several management options.

  
### **Mute**

  
Press Mute to turn off your microphone so the person on the other end can't hear you.

  
### **Hold**

  
Press Hold to put the entire call on hold, you can't hear them, they can't hear you.

  
### **Warm Transfer**

  
A warm transfer is when you call another user and talk to them about transferring the call. You can search for another user or manually dial another number. That will open a second call and you can switch between them.

  
Click Patch Call to connect the two calls together.

### **Blind Transfer**

  
A blind transfer is when you redirect the call to another number and disconnect yourself from it.

## **Troubleshoot Setup for Outbound Calls**

  
**Step 1**: Enable Microphone

Make sure that the microphone is allowed in the browser you are calling from. This might require special steps in [Windows 10](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/turn-on-app-permissions-for-your-microphone-in-windows-94991183-f69d-b4cf-4679-c98ca45f577a) or on [Mac](https://support.apple.com/en-om/guide/mac-help/mchla1b1e1fe/12.0/mac/12.0).

  
Check if the microphone is allowed by clicking on the icon to the left of the URL bar in Chrome.

**Step 2:** Prevent Interference From Extensions

Ensure there are no extensions, such as VPNs, that might be interfering with the Dialer. Try the browser in incognito/guest mode where there are no extensions.

**Step 3**: Set Call Timeout

Ensure the phone number's outbound call timeout is set to at least 20 seconds.

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

  
**Q: If I log in as the user with an assigned number, why are calls going out from the default number?**

A: Calls will be dialed out from the assigned number automatically if the user has **only assigned data** enabled and the user **role is User**. If the user has all records enabled (instead of only assigned data) then they can change the outgoing number in the Dialer's Calling From dropdown.

**Q: How do I removed "this call will be recorded for quality purposes"?**

A: We generally don't recommend removing the call recording warning because it is often required for legal purposes. If you do want to turn it off, or change it, you can learn about that in [Phone Number Settings Explained](https://help.gohighlevel.com/en/support/solutions/articles/48001229976). 

  
**Q: How do I avoid being marked as spam and/or how do I show my business name instead of my number in recipient's caller ID?**

A: You can improve your phone number's reputation and visibility in the Settings > Phone Numbers > Trust Center > CNAM. Learn more in [this article](https://help.gohighlevel.com/en/support/solutions/articles/48001231665).

  
**Q: How do I use the manual actions / power dialer?**

A: The power dialer is in Conversations > Manual Actions. You use a workflow to assign calls to be made as manual actions and then use the Manual Actions interface to go through them one by one. The manual actions list will open the contact card and use the Dialer automatically.
