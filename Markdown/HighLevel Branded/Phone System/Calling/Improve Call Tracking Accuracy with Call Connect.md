# **What is Call Connect?**

  
Call Connect is a call routing feature that ensures a real human interaction takes place before a call is marked as connected. When a contact answers, the system calls your assigned agent and waits for them to press a key (like “1”) before connecting the two parties. This keypad confirmation ensures the call is actually answered by an agent—not just sent to voicemail or missed—helping you avoid misleading “Completed” call statuses that can disrupt reporting and automations.

## **Key Benefits of Using Call Connect to Track Call Status**

  
* **Improved tracking accuracy**: Requires agent input to confirm pickup, reducing mislabeling of calls.
* **Reliable call reporting**: Only real conversations are counted, not missed calls or voicemails.
* **Accurate workflow triggers**: Automations respond only to actual agent-connected calls
* **Voicemail filtering**: Helps separate true pickups from voicemail routing.
* **Increased accountability**: Makes it easy to see when agents are engaging or missing calls.
* **Better lead follow-up**: Ensures follow-ups are based on real human interaction, not call attempts

## **Why “Completed” Call Status Can Be Misleading**

  
Twilio marks all calls as “Completed” once they finish routing—even if no one answers. This means calls sent to voicemail, missed by the agent, or timed out can still appear as successfully connected.

  
Call Connect solves this. With Call Connect enabled:  
  
* The agent receives a whisper message prompting them to press any button to accept the call.
* If the agent doesn’t answer or press a key, the call is never connected—and won’t be falsely marked as answered.

This small confirmation step makes a big difference in ensuring only real conversations are counted as successful connections.

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

  
**Q: Why are my calls marked “Completed” when no one answered?**  
Twilio’s default behavior marks all call attempts as “Completed,” even if the call wasn’t picked up or went to voicemail.  
  
**Q: How does Call Connect improve this?**  
It requires a human confirmation (keypress), so the system knows whether the call really connected.  
  
**Q: Does this apply to outbound and inbound calls?**  
Yes, it works in both directions. It's especially useful for inbound routing and rapid lead response.  
  
**Q: What if the agent doesn’t press a key?**  
The call is not considered connected, ensuring better tracking and cleaner reporting.  
  
**Q: Will this impact my automations?**
