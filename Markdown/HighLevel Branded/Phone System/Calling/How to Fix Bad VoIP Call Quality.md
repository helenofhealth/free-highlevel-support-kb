Diagnosing and resolving call quality issues ensures smoother operations and more effective communication. By methodically troubleshooting your environment—devices, network, and software—you can eliminate the most common causes of poor VoIP performance in HighLevel.  
  
* **Use a Wired Internet Connection:** Wi-Fi is more prone to packet loss and instability. Connect your device directly to your modem/router via Ethernet.

## **Advanced Troubleshooting: Jitter, Latency & Packet Loss**

  
Beyond basic internet issues, advanced VoIP problems often stem from network jitter, latency, and packet loss. Understanding these terms helps IT teams and power users identify deeper connectivity issues affecting HighLevel call performance.  
  
* **Jitter:** Irregular delays in packet delivery. Aim for less than 30ms.
* **Latency (RTT):** Delay between when a sound is sent and heard. Target under 150ms.
* **Packet Loss:** Lost voice data during transmission. Should always be 0%.
