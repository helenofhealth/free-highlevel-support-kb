**Overview**  
  
In this article, we will learn how we can increase our call answer rates by remediating 'spam likely' / 'potential spam' / 'scam likely' on the caller ID in the US (US only).

  
If the phone number flagged as 'spam likely' is relatively new or not critical to your business or has a FTC complaint, we recommend trashing the phone number and getting a new one. It's faster, easier and more convenient for you as compared to remediating the 'spam likely' tag.

  
If you have an EIN and your number is flagged as **‘Spam Likely’**, we recommend registering through **Voice Integrity**, available in the HighLevel portal. For full steps, see our article: [Why are my Calls marked as Spam, and How can I avoid it ?](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/48001231665)

If you **don’t have an EIN**, we suggest registering your number with the Free call registry instead.

**What is Voice Integrity?**  
  
Voice Integrity is a game-changing feature that helps protect your business calls from being flagged as “Spam Likely.” By registering your U.S.-based phone numbers with top caller ID analytics providers—First Orion, Hiya, and TNS—you can improve pickup rates and reinforce your brand’s trustworthiness.  
  
# **Why Turn On Voice Integrity?**

  
If your business numbers are flagged or blocked, Voice Integrity helps you:

* **Fix bad reputations** and clear “Spam Likely” labels from legitimate calls.
* **Increase pickup rates**—recipients are more likely to answer when your caller ID shows a verified, trusted name.
* **Ensure your calls are seen as authentic**, not suspicious.
* Boost **call answer rates** with a verified and trusted caller ID
* Help prevent your numbers from being **blocked** or **ignored**
* Maintain a **positive caller reputation** over time
* Establish **trust and credibility** with recipients
* Support consistent **branding** through accurate caller ID display
  
  
## **What You Need to Get Started**

  
Before activating Voice Integrity, ensure you meet these requirements:

* **SHAKEN/STIR Certification** (Required):  
Confirms your calls are legitimate and not spoofed.
* **CNAM Registration** (Recommended):  
Displays your business name as the caller ID, increasing credibility.
* **U.S. Phone Numbers Only**:  
Currently, Voice Integrity applies only to U.S.-based numbers. International traffic is not supported.

**Note**\- **An EIN (Employer Identification Number) is required to complete SHAKEN/STIR registration.** If you don’t have an EIN, we recommend registering your number with the Free call registry instead.
