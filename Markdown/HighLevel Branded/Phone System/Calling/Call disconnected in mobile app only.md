If calling works for desktop dialer here, but it failed using the mobile app only:
  
  
# 1\. Check if the Twilio Account SID is a master account or a sub-account

Once you are in the agency view, Click on Settings

Or simply go to <https://app.gohighlevel.com/settings/twilio>

Click on Twilio

Depending on which location you are having this issue, make sure the sub-account SID **is different from** the master Account SID on top.

  
We always need to use a Twilio sub-account SID to configure for the locations to call properly using the mobile app.

  
Another common case is that the location user would provide their own Twilio SID, which might be a Master Account SID that won't work with the mobile app.

## For locations that will be using **your client's own** Twilio account

There are two ways to fix it if the location is currently using your client's Master Account SID:

  
### 1st method: Create a subaccount in the client's Twilio account -> Move numbers -> Update in HighLevel

  
**[How to Create a new subaccount in Twilio from Console](https://support.twilio.com/hc/en-us/articles/360011348693-View-and-Create-New-Twilio-Subaccounts)**

1. Access the [**Subaccounts** page in Console](https://www.twilio.com/console/project/subaccounts).
2. Click **Create new Subaccount**, or the ![Icon_New.png](https://support.twilio.com/hc/article_attachments/360017865213/Icon_New.png) icon.
3. Enter the desired subaccount name, and then click **Create**.  
![Sub_04.png](https://support.twilio.com/hc/article_attachments/360017137614/Sub_04.png)
4. Once it is created, click into the subaccount and **copy the Account SID and auth token**

  
The client can open a ticket with Twilio to move the numbers from the master account to the subaccount by [following the instructions here](https://support.twilio.com/hc/en-us/articles/223135327-Moving-Twilio-Phone-Numbers-to-another-Twilio-project).
  
  
Click Update Credentials by clicking the three dots on the right

### 2nd method: Use Highlevel to create a subaccount based on the client's Twilio account SID
