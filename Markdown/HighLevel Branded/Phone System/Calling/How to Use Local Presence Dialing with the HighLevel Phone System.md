# **What is Local Presence Dialing?**

  
Local Presence Dialing dynamically selects the most appropriate outbound caller ID number based on a contact’s phone number area code. By leveraging region-specific numbers you’ve purchased, calls appear local to recipients, significantly improving pick-up rates and fostering trust.

  
## **Key Benefits of Local Presence Dialing**

  
Maximize engagement and streamline your outbound calling strategy with these powerful advantages:

* **Higher Answer Rates:** Local caller IDs feel familiar, encouraging recipients to answer unknown numbers.
* **Improved Brand Trust:** Consistent local presence builds credibility and reduces spam perception.
* **Automated Number Selection:** Eliminates manual switching—calls automatically use the matching regional number.
* **Scalable Multi-Region Support:** Easily manage multiple numbers across markets from a single dashboard.

  
## **How Local Presence Dialing Works**

  
Understand the mechanics behind automatic caller ID selection for seamless calling experiences.

* When initiating an outbound call, the system checks the contact’s phone number area code against your pool of verified numbers.
* If a matching regional number is available, the call uses that number as the caller ID.
* If no match exists, the default business number is used as a fallback.
* Number selection logic runs in real time without any user intervention.
