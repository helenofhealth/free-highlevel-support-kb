[New Sev-0 Fines on Prohibited A2P Traffic, Effective February 15, 2024](https://ideas.gohighlevel.com/changelog/new-sev-0-fines-on-prohibited-a2p-traffic-effective-february-15-2024)

What do you need to know? 

T-Mobile has introduced A2P 10DLC non-compliance fines for messages including prohibited content. If T-Mobile detects any messages that violate the tiers listed below, they will issue a Sev-0 violation (the most severe consumer violation), a non-compliance fine, and carriers will immediately block the offending messages.

This applies to all commercial messaging non-consumer A2P products (SMS or MMS short code, toll-free, and 10DLC) that traverse the T-Mobile network.

Because Sev-0 violations also infringe on HighLevel acceptable use and messaging policies, HighLevel will pass on these fines to you for every Sev-0 violation, starting February 15, 2024\. These fines include, but are not limited to, the following:

* Tier 1: $2,000: phishing (including simulated phishing sent for security testing or similar purposes), smishing, and social engineering. Social Engineering is a technique used to manipulate someone into sharing private information, like passwords or credit card numbers.
* Tier 2: $1,000: illegal content (content must be legal federally and in all 50 states)
* Tier 3: $500: all other violations in commercial messaging including but not limited to, SHAFT (sex, hate, alcohol, firearms, and tobacco) that do not follow federal and state law and regulations (e.g. age-gate).

These non-compliance fines apply to violations across any A2P messaging product (SMS/MMS short code, toll-free, and 10DLC). 

T-Mobile reserves the right to permanently suspend any brands, campaigns, and your companyâ€™s access to the T-Mobile Network in the event violations are deemed to be excessive. If you are subject to these fines, HighLevel will send you a Sev-0 violation notice and will subsequently charge the respective fine amount.

## **My use case is listed as forbidden. What can I do?**

If your use case is listed above as forbidden for SMS and MMS messaging in the US, you can explore other marketing channels.

Using **[LC Email](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/48001220605-what-is-lc-email-i-want-to-know-more)** is an option for many of the above use cases. For example, cannabis - or CBD-related messaging may be conducted via email, Facebook, Instagram, etc., as long as you have proper age gating in place and are sending toward recipients in a locale where the substance is legal.
