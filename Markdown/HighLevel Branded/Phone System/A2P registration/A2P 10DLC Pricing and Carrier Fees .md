# **A2P 10DLC Pricing Overview**

  
There are three primary categories of fees involved in A2P 10DLC messaging. These charges are set by The Campaign Registry (TCR), Twilio, and mobile carriers—and are passed through directly via LC Phone with no markup from HighLevel.  
  
* **Brand Registration and Campaign Vetting Fees** cover the cost of submitting your business brand and messaging campaigns to The Campaign Registry for compliance verification. These are one-time charges required to activate your ability to send messages through A2P 10DLC.
* **Monthly Campaign Fees** are recurring charges applied to each active campaign based on its selected messaging use case. These fees are billed monthly as long as the campaign remains active and are paid to The Campaign Registry.
* **Carrier Message Fees** are charged by mobile carriers (e.g., AT&T, T-Mobile, Verizon) for each outbound SMS segment or MMS message sent over their networks. Some carriers—like T-Mobile—also apply fees to inbound traffic.

All types of fees are required for using local U.S. numbers to send business messages through LC Phone. The sections below provide a full breakdown of each fee type and the associated costs.

  
Note: Rates are current as of May 5, 2025 for US only.

## **Brand Registration and Campaign Vetting Fees**

  
When registering for A2P 10DLC, both the brand and campaign must be submitted through the Trust Center. HighLevel presents these as a **single, bundled one-time fee** at the time of registration. This bundled amount includes:  
  
* Brand Registration
* Campaign Vetting
* Fast Track Processing ($3) to expedite approval within 3 business days

Monthly campaign fees are billed separately and vary based on campaign use case and volume. If a campaign is rejected and resubmitted, an additional Campaign Vetting Fee will be charged for each resubmission

  
### **Brand Types (Registration Tier) and Initial Fees**

  
| **Brand Type (Registration Tier)** | **One-Time Fee (Brand + Campaign + Fast Track)** | **Number and Messaging Limits**    |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------- |
| Sole Proprietor                    | $23.95                                           | 1 number, 3,000 segments/day       |
| Low Volume Standard                | $23.95                                           | Multi-number, 6,000 segments/day   |
| High Volume Standard               | $68.05                                           | Multi-number, 600,000 segments/day |

  
\*High Volume Bundle Includes Secondary Vetting for A2P 10DLC in case of first submission being rejected  
  
#### **Additional Campaigns and Resubmissions**

  
The bundled one-time fee is only charged during the initial registration of your brand and first campaign. It does not apply to future campaigns under the same brand.

  
* **Submitting another campaign under the same brand:**  
You will only pay the Campaign Vetting Fee of $15.00 per additional campaign.
* **Resubmitting a rejected campaign:**  
Each resubmission also incurs the $15.00 Campaign Vetting Fee again. High Volume Standard submissions include a second submission in the initial bundle price.

## **Monthly Campaign Fees**

  
Monthly campaign fees are recurring charges based on the messaging use case selected during campaign registration. Each campaign type has a monthly rate defined by TCR. Certain use cases may require additional vetting or documentation. Fees may vary based on use case sub-type.  
  
| **Campaign Use Case Type**         | **Monthly Fee (USD)** |
| ---------------------------------- | --------------------- |
| Sole Proprietor (Starter Campaign) | $2.00/month           |
| Standard Campaign Use Cases        | $10.00/month          |
| Low Volume Mixed Use Case\*        | $1.50/month           |
| Special Use: Charity / 501(c)(3)   | $3.00/month           |
| Special Use: Emergency Services    | $5.00/month           |

  
\*The Low Volume Mixed use case supports up to 2,000 SMS segments per day to T-Mobile and receives lower throughput regardless of Trust Score.

## **Per-Message Carrier Fees**

  
Carrier fees are applied per message segment and vary based on registration status and carrier. These are charged in addition to the LC Phone messaging rates. 

  
| Carrier     | Outbound SMS (USD) | Inbound SMS (USD) | Outbound MMS (USD) | Inbound MMS (USD) |
| ----------- | ------------------ | ----------------- | ------------------ | ----------------- |
| AT&T        | $0.003             | $0.003            | $0.0075            | $0.0075           |
| T-Mobile    | $0.003             | $0.003            | $0.001             | $0.001            |
| Verizon     | $0.003             | \-                | $0.005             | \-                |
| US Cellular | $0.005             | \-                | $0.01              | \-                |

  
Carriers may block or surcharge unregistered messages. Ensure your numbers are linked to registered A2P campaigns.

  
Note: T-Mobile acquired the Sprint network in 2020. Some devices still appear as "Sprint" in a Lookup. Messages sent to these users will have the same fees as other messages to T-Mobile.

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

  
**Q: What is a Trust Score and how does it affect my campaign?**  
Your Trust Score determines how many messages per second (MPS) your campaign can send. While there’s no direct fee associated with Trust Scores, they influence deliverability and messaging performance. A higher score results in higher throughput and fewer carrier filtering issues.[ ](https://help.gohighlevel.com/en/support/solutions/articles/155000004527)[Click here to learn more about Trust Scores](https://help.gohighlevel.com/en/support/solutions/articles/155000004527)

  
**Q: Do I need to pay the vetting fee more than once?**  
The Campaign Vetting Fee is charged for every campaign you submit, including the first campaign and any additional ones under the same brand. If a campaign is rejected and resubmitted, the fee is also charged again for each resubmission attempt.

  
**Q: Is the Brand Registration Fee charged for every campaign I create?**  
No. The Brand Registration Fee is charged only once when you register a new brand. If you submit additional campaigns under the same brand, only the Campaign Vetting Fee applies.

  
**Q: Are these fees charged by HighLevel?**  
No. All A2P 10DLC fees are passthrough charges from The Campaign Registry (TCR), Twilio, and U.S. mobile carriers. HighLevel does not add markup to these charges.

  
**Q: Can these prices change?**  
Yes. Prices are determined by external providers (TCR, Twilio, carriers) and may be adjusted at any time. Always review the current pricing displayed in the Trust Center before submitting a campaign.

  
**Q: What is a message segment?**  
A message segment refers to a single unit of text used for billing SMS messages. Most U.S. carriers define one segment as 160 characters of plain text. If your message exceeds 160 characters, it will be split into multiple segments and billed accordingly.
