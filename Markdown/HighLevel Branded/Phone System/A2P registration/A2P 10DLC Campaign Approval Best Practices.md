| Make sure consumer opt-in is collected appropriately                                                                                                   | **❌** **Your Campaign Will Be Rejected I** **f...** **Your Defined Opt-In Method When Registering:**Text message**Y** **our Sample Message When Registering:**“Hi, is this the owner of 123 Oak Street?

| We recommend having opt-out language in at least one of your sample messages.                                                                          | **For example, add** **language such as:**“Please reply STOP to opt-out” in one of your sample messages.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

  
| **⚠️ IMPORTANT NOTE:**Brands cannot submit Campaigns using **\[company name\]** and will need to update their flows to have their own **BRAND NAME** rather than **"the company"** or **"the business"**Brands cannot use HighLevel's **demo numbers in their opt-in flows** and **campaigns.**Brands cannot submit using HighLevel's **sample number provided in guidance.** _eg: "Additionally end users can also text START to +1 (213) 725-2867."_ |

## **Opt-In Methods**

  
Campaigns require a proper opt-in method which ensures that end-users provide consent to receive text messages. Verbal opt-in is the most difficult method to verify however, is acceptable as long enough details are provided that a 3rd party reviewer can verify.
  
  
### **1\. Verbal Opt-In**

Below is an example of a verbal opt-in, which would happen during a phone call with the consumer. You can also get a verbal opt-in by using a phone IVR flow, which would consist of an automated system getting opt-in confirmation from the consumer.

  
* **Phone IVR:** "As part of our service we can send you automated monthly text alerts regarding account payment activity. We will send two messages per month. Message and data rates may apply, depending on your mobile phone service plan. At any time you can get more help by replying HELP to these texts, or you can opt-out completely by replying STOP. Mobile Terms of Service are available at http://ghl.com/terms and our Privacy Statement can be found at https://ghl.com/privacy. Please reply with 'yes' or 'no' to indicate if you would like this service".  
    
**Customer:** "Yes please"  
    
**Phone IVR:** "Great! We will send you a text message to confirm your enrollment here shortly."
  
  
### **2\. Web Form Opt-In**

An embedded form on the end business’s website prompts end-users to enter their mobile phone number and opt into the texting campaign.
  
  
#### **⚠️ Important Requirements for Web Form Opt-In:**

1. Opt-in checkbox **MUST** be selectable by end-user
2. Opt-in checkbox **MUST**include a disclaimer (consent message) such as:  
   * _"I consent to receive sms notifications, alert from COMPANY NAME HERE. Message frequency varies. Message & data rates may apply. Text HELP to (XXX) XXX-XXX for assistance. You can reply STOP to unsubscribe at any time."_
3. Opt-in consent message and checkbox **MUST** be separated from **Privacy Policy | Terms of Service** and **Promotional** consent checkboxes. Promotional consent may be something like the following:  
   * _"By checking this box I agree to receive occasional marketing messages from INSERT COMPANY NAME HERE."_
4. Opt-in disclaimer **MUST** have All CTA (Call to Action) disclosures present to be considered compliant:  
    
   * Program name and/or a description of the messages that will be sent (appointment reminders, marketing messages, occasional offers, etc.)  
   * The organization or individual being represented in the initial message  
   * Fee disclosure (“Message and data rates may apply”)  
   * Service delivery frequency or recurring messages disclosure (“4 messages per month”, “Message frequency varies”, “1 message per login”, etc  
   * Customer care information (typically “Text HELP for help” or Help at XXX-XXX-XXXX) - not required for single message programs (i.e 2FA)  
   * Opt out instructions (typically “Text STOP to unsubscribe”) - not required for single message programs (i.e 2FA)  
   * Link to Privacy Policy describing how end user opt-in information will be used. Be sure there is no mention of sharing of personal information with Third Parties (Must not be part of the checkbox statement. Instead, provide the link at the bottom of the form)  
   * Link to Terms and Conditions describing terms of service (Must not be part of the checkbox statement. Instead, provide the link at the bottom of the form)  
   * Incorporate a checkbox option that end-users must select in order to receive SMS messaging. **The checkbox can not be pre-selected.** The checkbox provides the end-user the ability to agree, or not agree, to receive SMS messaging.

**Below are examples of Web form Opt-In flow.**

  
When **Phone Number** field is **Mandatory** in Web form OPT-IN.

* Consent checkboxes should be separated for both Marketing and Non-Marketing Messages.
* Consent **checkboxes cannot be pre-selected** and **should be optional** when **Phone Number is required.**
* SMS notifications cannot be forced in the form. Meaning **you cannot require BOTH consent and the phone number to proceed.**
* **Privacy Policy** and **TnC** at footer.

When **Phone Number** field not **Mandatory** in Web form OPT-IN.

* Consent checkbox not required when Phone Number field is not mandatory.
* **Privacy Policy** and **TnC** at footer.

**PLEASE NOTE:**

If the web opt-in is behind a login or not yet published, host a screen shot on a publicly accessible website (like OneDrive or Google Drive) and provide the image URL and the website URL in your registration form where it asks: **"How do end-users consent to receive messages?"**  
  
To get a useable image link, you can upload the screenshot to your **Media Storage Library** in your **HighLevel sub-account** as shown in the screenshot below:

**![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155042885322/original/9qbVCgtstKlyjO6laEDVt_0cdtG36TLs9w.png?1741396740)**

  
### **3\. Paper Form Opt-In**

An in-store visitor completes a physical form that collects their phone number and their consent to subscribe to your texting campaign.

Host a screenshot of the paper form on a publicly accessible website (like OneDrive or Google Drive or Subaccount's media library) and provide the URL in the answer for "How do end-users consent to receive messages?".
  
  
### **4\. Text Message Opt-In**

Host a screen shot of the campaign collateral on a publicly accessible website (like OneDrive or Google Drive or Subaccount's media library) and provide the URL in the answer for "How do end-users consent to receive messages?" along with the website URL.

  
![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155042885362/original/LK9mev9XVpw1mn8m7SVp1ZcKOBbSakBB6Q.png?1741397006)
  
  
### **5\. Mobile QR Code Opt-In**

You can also use a QR code that links to an online form prompting end-users to enter their mobile phone number and opt into the texting campaign.

  
QR codes can direct the consumer to the messaging application used on their mobile device (for example iMessage) with a templated opt-in message, or can even take the consumer directly to a web-form opt-in on your website.

  
**PLEASE NOTE:** If the QR code leads to a Web-Form Opt-In, please follow all requirements listed in this article above where we discuss the Web-Form Opt-In method.

# **Double Opt-In in A2P 10DLC**

Double Opt-In (DOI) is a compliance practice in A2P 10DLC messaging where users must confirm their consent twice before receiving SMS communications from a business. It enhances compliance with carrier and regulatory requirements, reducing the risk of spam complaints and improving message deliverability.

  
#### **How Double Opt-In Works**

  
#### **1\. Initial Sign-Up (First Opt-In)**

* A user expresses interest in receiving SMS messages by submitting their phone number via a web form, text message, mobile app, or another method.
* **Example:** A customer texts "JOIN" to a 10DLC number.

#### **2\. Confirmation Request (Second Opt-In)**

* The business sends an SMS asking the user to confirm their subscription, typically by replying with a keyword like "YES."
* **Example:** You requested to receive messages from \[Brand Name\]. Reply YES to confirm. Msg & data rates may apply.

#### **3\. Final Confirmation**

* Once the user replies with “**YES**,” they are officially subscribed and can receive further marketing or transactional messages.

  
#### **Why Double Opt-In is Important in A2P 10DLC**

* #### Reduced Spam Complaints: Prevents accidental or fraudulent sign-ups, reducing the risk of messages being marked as spam.
* Higher Deliverability: Carriers are more likely to allow traffic from numbers that follow proper opt-in procedures.
* Improved Customer Trust: Users who confirm twice are more engaged and less likely to opt out later.

##   

## ****How do end-users consent to receive messages?**

**The answer should contain the following information:**

1. **The program or product description**
2. **Telephone number(s) from which messaging will originate**
3. **Identify of the organization or individual being represented in the initial message**
4. **Clear and conspicuous language about opt-in and any associated fees or charges**
5. **Compliant Privacy Policy**
6. **Other applicable terms and conditions (e.g., how to opt-out, customer care contact information)**

**Opt-in needs to apply per campaign, should be not transferable or assignable and can not be obscured in terms and conditions (especially terms related to other services). If multiple opt-in methods can be used for the same campaign, please list them all.**

**A compliant Privacy Policy must state that no mobile information will be shared with third parties/affiliates for marketing/promotional purposes. Information sharing to subcontractors in support services, such as customer service is permitted. All other use case categories exclude text messaging originator opt-in data and consent; this information will not be shared with any third parties.**

**Campaign reviewers need to be able to verify details provided in this field. Provide evidence such as a hosted link to screenshot or document for opt-in that occurs behind a gated login or on a paper form.**

## **Campaign Failure/Rejection Reasons**

  
You can now view rejection reasons directly in the UI. Once you are in the Trust center tab, click on "Failed" to review the Campaign Failure Reason. All failed/rejected campaigns will now display their specific failure reasons.

  
**PLEASE NOTE:** TCR (The Campaign Registry) often rejects a campaign based on the first issue they encounter, potentially overlooking other issues. Do not focus solely on the rejection reason and instruct the client on how to resolve it, as they might correct that issue, resubmit, and face rejection again for a different reason. Instead, review the entire campaign submission and the client’s website to ensure everything is correct and compliant.
