# **What Are Campaign Use Case Types?**

  
Campaign use case types represent the specific purpose of your SMS or MMS messages. When registering a campaign, you're required to select a use case that accurately describes the nature of your communication—such as customer care, two-factor authentication, or marketing. Choosing the correct campaign type is essential to meet industry compliance standards, avoid filtering or blocking, and maintain trust with carriers and recipients.

### **Special Campaign Use Cases**

  
Certain campaigns are categorized as "special" by carriers and require additional documentation, verification, or pre-qualification. These often involve sensitive or regulated communications. Special use cases may involve different fees, verification requirements, and carrier-specific restrictions.  
  
* **Charity / 501(c)(3) Nonprofit**: For registered nonprofit organizations conducting charitable outreach. Must provide IRS nonprofit verification.
* **Emergency Services**: Used by government agencies to deliver urgent safety or emergency messages. Strictly limited and regulated.
* **Political**: For political messaging, including campaigns, parties, and PACs. Requires verification through Campaign Verify.

### **Low-Volume Use Cases**

  
In addition to the standard “Mixed” or “Marketing” campaign types, there is a dedicated use case called Low Volume Mixed. This option is intended for businesses with lighter SMS needs. It supports the same range of message types as a standard Mixed campaign—such as marketing, customer care, and notifications—but comes with a lower monthly fee. Unlike other campaign types, Low Volume Mixed is locked to the lowest available throughput tier, regardless of the brand’s Trust Score. This makes it an ideal, cost-effective choice for small businesses or organizations that don’t require high-volume messaging.

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

  
**Q: What happens if I choose the wrong campaign use case?**  
Choosing the wrong use case can lead to campaign rejection, delivery filtering, or compliance issues. Always select the use case that best matches the primary intent of your messages.

  
**Q: Can I register more than one campaign use case?**  
Yes. If your business sends different types of messages (e.g., marketing and customer support), you may need to register multiple campaigns, each with its appropriate use case.

  
**Q: Can I switch my campaign use case after it’s approved?**  
No. To change your use case, you'll need to register a **new campaign** with the updated details and sample messages.
