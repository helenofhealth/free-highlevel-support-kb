**Date Updated:** 2025-03-26T19:46:05.000Z

To align with industry standards, we are updating our messaging policies concerning Canadian 10-digit long code (10DLC) numbers. These changes pertain to messages sent from Canadian numbers to recipients in both the United States and Canada.

**Key Changes:**

1. **Messaging from Canada to the United States:**  
   * Effective immediately, all messages sent from Canadian 10DLC numbers to U.S. recipients must originate from Application-to-Person (A2P) registered numbers. This requirement applies to both new and existing Canadian numbers.
2. **Messaging within Canada:**  
   * For new Canadian 10DLC numbers purchased after 26th March 2025, A2P registration is mandatory to send messages to Canadian recipients.  
   * Existing Canadian 10DLC numbers used for messaging within Canada are not required to undergo A2P registration at this time, except as noted in point 1.

**Important Notes:**

* These updates apply exclusively to 10DLC numbers. Toll-Free (TF) numbers are not affected and will continue to operate under existing guidelines.[](https://simpletexting.com/sms-compliance/10dlc-registration/?utm%5Fsource=chatgpt.com)

**Understanding A2P 10DLC Registration:**

A2P 10DLC is a system that allows businesses to send Application-to-Person type messaging via standard 10-digit long code phone numbers. Registering your numbers under this framework helps ensure compliance with carrier regulations and enhances message deliverability.

* **For New Canadian 10DLC Numbers:** Ensure A2P registration is completed before initiating messaging to recipients in either the U.S. or Canada.
* **For Toll-Free Numbers:** No action is required; existing policies remain in effect.
