# **What is A2P Sole Proprietor Brand Registration?**

  
Sole Proprietor registration is ideal for individuals or small businesses in the U.S. and Canada who operate under their own name, have no formal business entity or Tax ID (like an EIN), and only one employee. This registration allows them to send compliant SMS/MMS messages via 10DLC (10-Digit Long Code) channels, ensuring better messaging compliance and deliverability.

---

  
## **Key Benefits of A2P Sole Proprietor Brand Registration**

  
* Legally send SMS/MMS through 10dlc-compliant routes.
* Build brand trust with better deliverability and fewer message filtering issues.
* Avoid heavy carrier penalties for unregistered messaging.
* Access basic messaging throughput suitable for low-volume messaging needs.

---

## **What are the Requirements for Sole Proprietor Registration?**

  
Sole Proprietor brands are available to individuals or small businesses who meet the following requirements:

  
* **No Tax ID:** Customers with a tax ID are not eligible for Sole Proprietor Brands; they should use a Low Volume Standard Brand instead.
* **1 Phone Number per Campaign:** Sole Proprietor accounts purchasing multiple local numbers may encounter errors when texting, specifically error code 30034, even with approved numbers. This issue arises because each purchased number needs to be specifically linked to an approved A2P 10DLC campaign.
* **OTP Verification:** Confirm your identity using a One-Time Password (OTP) verification step.
* **Valid Details:** Must include a valid and accurate business name, first name, last name, email address, phone number, and physical address.
* **US Addresses:** Only valid U.S. addresses (including P.O. boxes) are allowed. Addresses in other countries are no longer permitted.
* **Operate under your legal name:** No LLC, Corporation, etc.
* **Carrier-matching contact details:** Mobile number and email must match carrier records for successful verification.
