# Industry Standards for US Short Code Terms of Service

  
To ensure your short code campaign aligns with LC Phone's requirements, your company must adhere to carrier compliance requirements, industry standards, and applicable law.

This mobile terms of service should include specific provisions such as customer support contact information, complete opt-out instructions (displayed in bold), a recurring message disclosure (if applicable), a product description, and a program (brand) name. Additional requirements may exist for certain programs like sweepstakes or contests. For more information on industry standards, please refer to the [CTIA’s Short Code Monitoring Handbook](https://www.wmcglobal.com/us-resources).

  
Beyond these standards, there may be additional compliance requirements under applicable law based on the nature of your text messaging campaign. It is advisable to consult with your legal counsel to ensure that your terms of service and privacy policy are compliant with applicable law and consistent with standards for your specific campaign and industry.

[New Sev-0 Fines on Prohibited A2P Traffic, Effective February 15, 2024](https://ideas.gohighlevel.com/changelog/new-sev-0-fines-on-prohibited-a2p-traffic-effective-february-15-2024)

What do you need to know? 

T-Mobile has introduced A2P 10DLC non-compliance fines for messages including prohibited content. If T-Mobile detects any messages that violate the tiers listed below, they will issue a Sev-0 violation (the most severe consumer violation), a non-compliance fine, and carriers will immediately block the offending messages.

This applies to all commercial messaging non-consumer A2P products (SMS or MMS short code, toll-free, and 10DLC) that traverse the T-Mobile network.

Because Sev-0 violations also infringe on HighLevel acceptable use and messaging policies, HighLevel will pass on these fines to you for every Sev-0 violation, starting February 15, 2024\. These fines include, but are not limited to, the following:

* Tier 1: $2,000: phishing (including simulated phishing sent for security testing or similar purposes), smishing, and social engineering. Social Engineering is a technique used to manipulate someone into sharing private information, like passwords or credit card numbers.
* Tier 2: $1,000: illegal content (content must be legal federally and in all 50 states)
* Tier 3: $500: all other violations in commercial messaging including but not limited to, SHAFT (sex, hate, alcohol, firearms, and tobacco) that do not follow federal and state law and regulations (e.g. age-gate).

These non-compliance fines apply to violations across any A2P messaging product (SMS/MMS short code, toll-free, and 10DLC). 

T-Mobile reserves the right to permanently suspend any brands, campaigns, and your company’s access to the T-Mobile Network in the event violations are deemed to be excessive. If you are subject to these fines, HighLevel will send you a Sev-0 violation notice and will subsequently charge the respective fine amount.
