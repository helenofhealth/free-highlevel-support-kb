## **What is Email OTP Verification for A2P Brand Registration?**

  
Email OTP Verification for A2P Brand Registration is a security enhancement integrated into HighLevel’s A2P brand registration flow. It validates each email address by sending a unique 6-digit one-time password to ensure the sender’s identity is genuine. This process helps safeguard against brand impersonation and phishing by requiring users who do not trigger Persona verification to prove email ownership before progressing through registration.
