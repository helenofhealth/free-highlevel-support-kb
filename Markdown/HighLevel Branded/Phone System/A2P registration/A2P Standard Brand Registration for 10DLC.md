# **What is A2P Standard Brand Registration?**

  
A2P messaging refers to any message sent from an application to a person — for example, automated marketing texts or appointment reminders. To send A2P messages in the U.S., you **must register your brand and campaign(s) with The Campaign Registry (TCR)** through your messaging provider (e.g., Twilio).

  
A Standard Brand is designed for businesses registered with an EIN. It allows **greater messaging throughput and access to a wider variety of campaign use cases** than Sole Proprietor brands.

  
**Note:** If your business **does not have an EIN** and **only has one employee per company**, you can register for sole prop here: [A2P Sole Proprietor Brand Registration for 10DLC](https://help.gohighlevel.com/en/support/solutions/articles/155000000340)

## **Handling the "Maximum 3 Tries Exhausted" Error**

  
If you see the error "**Maximum 3 tries exhausted"**, please [**fill out this form**](https://link.gohighlevel.com/widget/form/mfl7sSEccNAaQZOCalsA) once you have collected the **CP 575 Form.** It means the registration attempts have failed due to mismatched or invalid business details.  
  
### **Next Steps:**

  
1. **Obtain your CP 575 EIN Confirmation Letter** (or request a 147c letter from the IRS if the CP 575 is unavailable).
2. **Upload your business registration form** in your support communication with us.
3. **Email or send a screenshot** of your CP 575 form to the HighLevel team.

We will submit this documentation on your behalf for Brand approval.

### **Important Tips:**

  
* Ensure the **legal business name and EIN number exactly match** what’s shown on the CP 575 form.
* Do **not** use the business name found on W2 or W9 forms, as they may differ.
* If the business name spans multiple lines on your CP 575/147c letter, you must enter **all lines above the address line** during registration.  
    
**Example:**  
    
ABC Holding Group Inc.  
Division of Regional Services  
123 Main Street  
New York, NY 10001  
    
**The legal name to enter would be:** ABC Holding Group Inc. Division of Regional Services

## **Understanding Trust Scores & Throughput**

  
Once submitted, your brand will be vetted and assigned a **Trust Score (0–100) by TCR**.

Higher scores allow for **higher Message Throughput (MPS)** and **better delivery rates**. The Trust Score is determined based on your submitted information — EIN match, business type, domain verification, and more.

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

  
**Q: What’s the difference between Sole Proprietor and Standard Brand?**  
Sole Prop is for individuals without an EIN. Standard Brand is for registered U.S. businesses with an EIN.  
  
**Q: Why was my brand rejected?**  
Likely reasons include EIN mismatch, invalid website, or use of a PO Box.

  
**Q: Can I add new numbers after completing A2P Brand and Campaign Registration?**

You can continue messaging in the U.S. without A2P 10DLC restrictions. See: [Toll-Free Verification Guide for LC - Phone (US/Canada)](https://help.gohighlevel.com/en/support/solutions/articles/48001222300)
