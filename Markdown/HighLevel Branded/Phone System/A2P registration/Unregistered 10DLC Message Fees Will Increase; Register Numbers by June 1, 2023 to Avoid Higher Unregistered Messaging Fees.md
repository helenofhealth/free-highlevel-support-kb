# What do you need to know? 

  
To send messages in the US, you **must register all 10DLC phone numbers**. As a result, AT&T and T-Mobile are **increasing the per-message rate on unregistered traffic to motivate unregistered senders to register**. If these numbers remain unregistered, they may be subject to **additional filtering or blocking**. 

  
Some **carrier fees will be increased** on June 1, 2023, and others will be increased on August 1, 2023.

  
Most customers are observing significant savings and better deliverability by registering their 10DLC numbers.
