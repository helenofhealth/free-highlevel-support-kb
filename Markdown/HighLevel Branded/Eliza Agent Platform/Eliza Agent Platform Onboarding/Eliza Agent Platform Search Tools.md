### **Add Contact**

Eliza users can add a contact to a sub-account through Eliza by navigating to Search -> Contacts. These contacts will be synced to the respective GHL sub-account with the contact source field as ‘Eliza\_User.’ Once the contact is added to a sub-account through Eliza, the Eliza agent will have to assign it to themself or another agent manually. The sub-account audit log will show an entry for the added contact.
