## **Eliza Agent Platform Settings**

###   
  
**Setting up a new location in the Eliza Agent Platform**
  
  
Using Eliza's account starts with adding a location to the account. 

  
Start by clicking the **"Add Location"** button on **Settings > Locations**

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/48290277242/original/WlVQGxXIL5J52wKCL4014tC2fbeOq349yQ.png?1680196895)

  
Select the Location from the dropdown, and the Location from HL will be added to Eliza. 

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/48290277257/original/847OCAC4AzsmfBubPCCfCjB2kqEYjBaHYw.jpeg?1680196898)
  
  
Once the Location is selected from the dropdown, it will show the screen where you need to choose an optional default calendar and set a priority. 

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/48290277233/original/dgCCMV_5k9LnB5qh6T0CVdig_X041oe06w.png?1680196890)

  
A priority is a generic feature provided by EAP for managing how to prioritize locations within your Eliza account. Locations can be prioritized based on time zones, service level agreements for specific locations, etc.

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/48290277232/original/FPpnyueICKgukEvZeocXh-XIlZ12CPBZ4g.png?1680196890)

  
Choose the agents who can handle the conversations in this Location from the previously created list of agents.  
![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/48290277246/original/wwH_FLvvYGUI8iPtoxFLJ11lMrK_ZACSCw.png?1680196898)

A note can be added that will be available in the Settings > Announcements section for agents to see. 

Announcements are available only for those agents assigned to work on this Location.

  
The selected Location can also be removed from Eliza on this screen. Once all of the above is configured, click on **Add Location** to add the account to Eliza.

### **Setting up your team members**

  
On Settings > Team screen, you can add team members as agents or admins. 

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/48290277250/original/rigWbadRkjfIXF7D4oOE_B4D48ezdE1wvg.png?1680196899)

The newly added member will receive an email with a link to set up the password for the account.

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/48290277248/original/wso_6V5fO1F199mzJrXt8QbnHQkq0M39aA.png?1680196898)

### **Eliza Account setup**

Any incoming conversations will be automatically assigned to agents configured to work on that Location in a round-robin fashion. This happens only among the agents who are online. 

  
."

  
Any incoming message part of a conversation assigned to a particular agent will still go to the same agent, even if they are offline. 

  
### **Configuring Webhooks.**

Go to **Settings > Company.![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/48290277252/original/_upzFOaiLkVU22YyAH8su4EcS64UmnnrVg.png?1680196899)**

Configure the webhook to alert the agents for the following situations.

| **Type of message**  | **Description**                                                                     | **Keys Configured**                                                                                  |

### **Dispositions setup**

  
Dispositions are a great way to manage and track different stages of a conversation. 

Enter following details

  
1. Disposition name.
2. Short name.
3. Tag that needs to be assigned when this disposition is assigned.
4. Whether comments are allowed while assigning the disposition.
5. Whether the comments are mandatory.
6. An option to delete the disposition that is already created.

  
An agent can choose the disposition while ending the conversation, and the comments entered while assigning the disposition can be retrieved from Settings > Disposition Comments. The disposition can also be re-ordered so that the ordering reflects on the 'Conversation' screen when you click 'End chat.'
  
  
![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/48290288548/original/TRSvVX_P-WP0v--i2sGsXzELUYm4XiDNKQ.jpeg?1680201553)
  
  
#### **System Dispositions**

  
#### Waiting for the customer's response

Assigned by the system automatically when the agent chooses to close the conversation while waiting for the customer's response. 

  
#### Appointment Booked

It is assigned automatically whenever the agent books an appointment. 

  
#### Autoclosed

  
Assigned in the following situations

  
* Pause Conversations

### **Disposition Comments Tab**
  
  
![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/48290288533/original/vUBOaJp1sGBq71T9j36WdQM-xwgPOFe1FQ.png?1680201545) 

Only those dispositions that allow comments will show up in this tab.
  
  
All the comments the agent enters are available on Settings > Disposition Comments. Here you can filter by Location, the disposition name, the agent name, and the date of assignment of the disposition comment. 

  
This screen can review the comments and see if the business process can be made more efficient or create an FAQ. 

  
## Downloading the comments

All the dispositions entered can be downloaded as an excel file using the download button at the top right corner for the chosen criteria, such as Location, Disposition name, and agent. 
  
  
![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/48290289460/original/BMCF86Icz5aM2A7iL7bU2XcOHShIlO8U_g.png?1680201944)

### **FAQ management - Templates and Location FAQs**

  
FAQs are an efficient way to increase agent productivity. 

  
![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/48290290006/original/xKR0dE1JFdPpSgJDC2c5dWt2uPZh2-qeyQ.png?1680202145)
  
  
When you create an FAQ, the system will give a default set of questions you can use. If you need a different set of questions, you can create your own via the "Add FAQ" button.
  
  
![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/48290290123/original/vVpURDuGd6rEqSzcBOg9dDFpjlnBr3saDw.png?1680202190)
  
  
If you want to define the questions and want your clients to enter answers, you can enter the questions in the Location and ask your clients to login into [https://app.gohighlevel.com/v2/location/<<locationid>>/settings/eliza\_faq](https://app.gohighlevel.com/v2/location/X5392tCsXVshYg8R5fll/settings/eliza%5Ffaq) and enter the answers. These answers will be available on the Eliza Agent Platform. Please note that the subaccount should have access to the Sub-Account **settings > Eliza Service tab**. Enable this tab via User permissions for that user.

  
You can also use custom values in the answers by clicking the icon near the answer box.

  
A template can be assigned to one or more locations by clicking the "Assign" button. The assignment operation works like a mathematical set union operation. 

1. If the question is available only on the template and not on Location, then this new question will be added to the Location.
2. If the question is available on the template and the answer is blank, it will NOT be overridden when assigned to the Location with the same question, but with a valid answer, it will NOT be overridden.
3. If the question is available on the template with a valid answer, and the Location also has an answer, it will override the one already available.
4. If the question is available on the template and not on the Location, then this will be added as a new question.
