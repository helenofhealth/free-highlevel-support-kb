The Quickbooks integration comes with a built-in automation to [send a Review Request](https://help.gohighlevel.com/en/support/solutions/articles/48001222668) whenever a contact's first invoice is paid in full (balance drops to $0). This is independent of manual and workflow actions to send a Review Request. This can be left enabled, or it can be disabled.

The Quickbooks Automatic Review Request is built into the integration, it does not use the HighLevel Workflow triggers/actions. The Workflow trigger for Invoice Paid does not respond to invoices paid in Quickbooks, only to invoices paid in HighLevel.

# **What is the Quickbooks Automatic Review Request?**

  
A Review Request is a HighLevel feature that sends a prebuilt message (email or SMS) to a contact asking them to review the service provider. The Quickbooks integration is a feature that connects Quickbooks to HighLevel so that certain information can be passed back and forth. The Quickbooks integration has a built-in automation that will send a Review Request to a contact the first time they pay an invoice down to $0.

## **Why does the Quickbooks integration have an automatic Review Request?**

  
Every small business should be asking for reviews and most of them aren't asking often enough. An excellent time to ask for a review is right after the first transaction has closed. This can be automated by connecting to Quickbooks to get a message when the first invoice is paid down to $0.

## **How can I turn off / disable the Quickbooks automatic Review Request?**

  
For a period of time there was no way to disable this automatic Review Request. In Oct 2024 a new feature was released that allows toggling this feature on / off. You can control this in Subaccount > Settings > Integrations > Quickbook Integration > deselect "Send Review Requests for contacts". You can turn it back on / reenable later.
