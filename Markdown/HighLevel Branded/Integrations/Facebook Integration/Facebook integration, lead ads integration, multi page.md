# Pre-requisites for Facebook Lead Ads

* Access: You must have access to the Facebook page for which you're creating lead ads. Refer to this FacebookHelp article on [how to give someone a role on your Page](https://www.facebook.com/help/187316341316631).
* Ownership: Ensure the same user owns the page and the ad account. For business-level integrations, the owner of the page and the ad account must be the same—more on this in the Facebook help section on [Ad account roles](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/187316341316631?id=520795622598421).
* Permissions: Verify that you have the page and ad account permissions. You should ideally have admin or manage permissions. To understand different levels of permissions, refer to [Facebook Pages roles](https://www.facebook.com/help/323502271070625) and [Ads permissions](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/187316341316631?id=520795622598421). The user trying to integrate the Facebook Page into the CRM will [need to be an admin of the Facebook Business page](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/2169003770027706?id=2190812977867143) and have [Lead Access Permission](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/540596413257598?id=735435806665862) to access Lead data (A requirement set by Facebook).
* Ad Account Check: Confirm your page is connected to the appropriate ad account. To do this, navigate to the Ad Account settings and verify the connected page—more on [how to navigate your ad account settings](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/337584869654348).
* Visibility: Note that only individuals with relevant permissions can see the owners of ad accounts. For details, check Facebook's guide on [user permissions for ad accounts](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/187316341316631?id=520795622598421).
* Leads Access: Check if you have lead access. If the lead connector isn't showing, you may need to manually search for it or enable it. For issues related to leads not syncing, refer to Facebook's [troubleshooting guide for lead ads](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/1667649039945425).
* LeadConnector will need access to the Facebook Business Manager and Business Page from which you run the Facebook Lead Ad.
* You can allow trusted people to manage some of your Facebook business pages. You can give some people [access](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/582754542592549?id=418112142508425) to certain parts of your Facebook page without giving them full access.
* Open business manager > Left navigation > Users > People. If you have added the person, who will be integrating the FB page to the CRM, there already: they will appear at the centre of the page.  
[How to add users to your business?](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/2169003770027706?id=2190812977867143)
