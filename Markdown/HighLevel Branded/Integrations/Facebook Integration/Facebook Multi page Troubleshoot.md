1. **Do you have full access control of the Facebook page - [](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/2169003770027706)**[](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/2169003770027706)[Add people to a business portfolio and assign a business asset](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/2169003770027706)[](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/2169003770027706)**[](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/2169003770027706)[](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/2169003770027706?id=2190812977867143)**
2. **Now in your Sub-Account, check in settings> integrations > Facebook form fields mapping check if the form you have selected in ads manager is enabled in status**
3. **Can you try this to confirm if Lead Connector is accessible and has access to your page? - <https://www.facebook.com/settings?tab=business%5Ftools&ref=settings>**

## How do I integrate Facebook Leads using a 3rd party service like Pabbly Connect or Zapier?

****You can use a 3rd parties integration tool like Zapier or Pabbly Connect. Here is [more info](https://help.gohighlevel.com/en/support/solutions/articles/48001223700)**

## A Facebook Token Has Expired In a Sub-Account; why does this happen, and How to Fix This?

**If** you received an email with a subject that says "Important: Facebook connection has expired.", this means that the Facebook integration for one of your Sub-accounts has become disconnected.

### Why Did This Connection Break?

Several reasons could cause the integration to break. The most common are: 

* A user changes their password
* The Facebook token naturally expires after some time
* A user de-authorizes your app
* A user logs out of Facebook
* A user changes page permission or adds/removes a user
* A virtual assistant in another country logs in without using a VPN

### To reconnect:

1\. Select the account indicated in the email you received from the "Switch To An Account" dropdown

2\. In the left-hand sidebar, click "Settings."

3\. From the sidebar, click "Integrations."

4\. Click the "Connected" button to disconnect the broken integration under the Facebook icon. Click on Connect again to reconnect

5\. In the window that pops up, continue as yourself, select the Facebook page that you want to connect, then click the "Connect Page" button
