## **Troubleshooting**

  
### **I see an error message No pages for this account. What should I do?**

If you encounter this error while integrating your business account, please ensure you have created an instant form in your TikTok business account. Please follow [these steps.](https://ads.tiktok.com/help/article?aid=9525)

  
###   
**My TikTok 'Access Token' is expired. What should I do?** 

If your access token is expired, please disconnect your account from the CRM integration page. Once you re-integrated, the CRM will generate a new access token. if you continue to have this issue, please notify the support.
  
  
### **I changed a question on my Lead Ad Form during a live campaign. What should I do?** 

Let's say you updated your lead ad form within TikTok to capture a new desired response. You will need to head back into your sub-account settings and [create a custom field for the new desired response](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/48001223558-how-to-integrate-tiktok-lead-ads#Step-3%3A%C2%A0Map-Fields-and-or-create-Custom-Fields). Once this is complete, head back into the '**TikTok Form Fields Mapping tab**,' hit the edit button, and select the new custom field you had just created.  
  
If you want to stop all inbound leads, toggle the status off:

### **Can the same TikTok account ID be connected to multiple sub-accounts in HL (same agency or across different agencies) without issues?** 

Yes, as long as both accounts have the TikTok Form fields mapped.

###   

  
### **What are all the permissions on TikTok that the person who connects the integration will need to maintain so that the integration token does not expire?**

Only LeadConnector needs permission, which is taken care of when the integration is connected. User permissions and access are not an issue.
  
  
### **What would cause the integration token to expire, and how can we minimize it on our side to ensure a stable integration?**

TikTok grants the CRM a permanent access token, so the integration should remain intact unless manually broken off by the user. We will display an Integration expired message under the TikTok integration option in settings> Integration.
