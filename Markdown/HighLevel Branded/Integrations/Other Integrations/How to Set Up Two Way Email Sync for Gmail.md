Two-way sync for Gmail allows users to integrate their Gmail account with the CRM and enables the synchronization of emails between the two platforms. This integration creates a connection between the platforms and syncs both ways.

* Sync inbound and outbound emails from existing contacts to GHL
* Create contacts and add conversations seamlessly from Gmail
* Real-time bidirectional email synchronization for improved efficiency.

  
**Important Note:**   
  
Gmail Two-Way Sync must be set up from within a sub-account, not at the agency dashboard level. You must either be logged into the sub-account directly or use the “Login As” feature from the agency view to access the sub-account. This ensures the Gmail connection applies to conversations inside the correct CRM location.

## **What is Gmail Two way sync?** 

Gmail Two-Way Sync is a feature that enables the bidirectional synchronization of emails between Gmail and CRM. It allows users to integrate their Gmail account with the CRM, establishing a connection that keeps emails in sync across both systems. Any emails sent, received, or updated in Gmail will be automatically reflected in the CRM, and vice versa. The two-way sync ensures that users have a unified and up-to-date view of their emails, regardless of their platform. This feature streamlines email campaigns improves productivity, and ensures that important email communications are accessible in both Gmail and the CRM.

**How does the 2-way sync work between the CRM and your email account?**

  
There are two cases of how the sync can be established.  
  
1\. You can email a contact from the CRM to initiate the sync between both platforms.  
2\. Gmail Sync also works if a contact that is already saved in the CRM sends an email to the User (who has Gmail Two Way sync integrated) on their Gmail Email address. The email would sync into the conversations tab.

  
Note: Emails from contacts who also happen to be sub-account users are not synced. Often, sub-account users are added as contacts for various purposes. Such emails are not synced as they may contain confidential information. If the email address doesn’t belong to a user, emails will sync as mentioned above.

  
**Please note**

If the user is added to multiple sub accounts, and has integrated the same Gmail account for Gmail Two way sync in all those accounts, the email from the contact will go to the conversations tab of all those sub accounts, but we will only retain the instance of that contact in that sub account to which the user replies to. Sync will be broken for all other instances.The additional filter of user being assigned to the existing contact also makes sure that the conversation will not go to sub accounts that the contact does not belong to.

The sent email will show up in the sent inbox of the integrated Gmail account:

**Please Note:**

Gmail supports only ~500 emails per day and emails beyond that will be unsuccessful.
  
  
All subsequent messages in the email thread will be in sync. Outbound emails from your email will reflect in the CRM and vice versa.

## **Other functionalities**

  
### **Update Email:** 

This helps users change their connected email ID to another without disconnecting the previous connection.

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/48287100704/original/n1NZvUej6xWS0WzV2yaUOKHk26_hCz7Q_w.png?1678792018)
  
  
New outbound emails from the CRM will start syncing with the newly added email address. Upcoming messages in the previously connected email ID (same thread) will stop syncing between the CRM & personal email. 

  
### **Disconnect Email:** 

This helps users to disconnect their connection and stop the sync with the CRM. Post disconnect, emails or messages will not sync between both platforms.

  
![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/48287100962/original/TLimKgIGciSFjVlNRy0jRHtoAQdktaxIpA.png?1678792076)

###   

### **BCC Address**

You can include the BCC Address in the Cc or Bcc field when sending an email from Gmail/Outlook. Doing so will automatically add the contact and conversation to your CRM, streamlining communication and ensuring all relevant data is centralized. Going forward, any emails received from this contact at the Gmail/Outlook inbox level will automatically sync with CRM.

**Please Note:**

  
You may receive a "Delivery incomplete" error from Gmail when using BCC addresses. This occurs because we use BCC for logging purposes, and Gmail doesn't get a delivery receipt for BCC addresses.   
  
Despite the error, your message might still be successfully posted to the CRM.

## **Does Two-way sync only work with individual emails or bulk emails and workflows?**

  
How the sender domain mapping works for different types of emails:

  
**Individual Email:** On connecting a personal email account (Gmail), the Gmail email ID will be considered the sender domain for the emails the user sends for individual emails. Individual emails are sent directly from Gmail when 2-way sync is activated for the user. Be aware that Google sets a limit of 500 emails daily, which applies to this functionality.

**Bulk Email:** This will continue to be sent from the sub-account level email provider. 2-way sync won't affect this.

  
**Workflow & Automation:** In terms of automated emails, they are not sent from the 2-way sync but dispatched from the defined sub-account level providers. This arrangement seamlessly integrates your automated CRM workflows and the email dispatch system.

  
**Please Note:**

With this setup, users can leverage the 2-way sync for their one-on-one emails while also successfully sending bulk emails. The Gmail-imposed limit of 500 emails per day applies only to individual emails, so users can send bulk emails via LeadConnector/SMTP without worrying about reaching this limit. This is a thoughtful design feature, allowing users to conduct mass email campaigns without being constrained by Gmail's daily email cap.
