## **Frequently Asked Questions**

  
**Q: Can I schedule tasks with dynamic dates or create them automatically based on triggers?**

While the Tasks section allows manual task creation for your team, **advanced task scheduling and automation—like setting dynamic due dates (e.g., “2 days from now at 5PM”)—must be configured via workflows**.

To do this, use the **“Add Task”** workflow action under **Automation > Workflows**. This gives you full control over assigning tasks and defining dynamic due times based on triggers like form submissions, opportunity updates, and more.
