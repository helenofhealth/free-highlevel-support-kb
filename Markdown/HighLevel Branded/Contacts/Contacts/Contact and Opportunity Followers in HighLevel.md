The ‘Followers’ feature for Contacts and Opportunities allows multiple users to follow and access the same record. This provides you the ability to add up to 10 users as followers who are able to view and edit the CRM record when the "Only Assigned Data" user permission is turned on.

## **What Are Followers?**

  
Followers are users added to a contact or opportunity who gain access to view and manage that record, **even if they normally have restricted data access** under the "Only Assigned Data" permission setting.

  
### **Follower Permissions & Limitations**

* **Followers inherit the same permissions as the record owner.**
* This allows them to **view and edit** the contact or opportunity information.
* However, they **cannot modify the ownership itself** — i.e., they **cannot change the owner** of the record.

## Contact Followers

Followers can be added to contacts on the detailed page of the record.
