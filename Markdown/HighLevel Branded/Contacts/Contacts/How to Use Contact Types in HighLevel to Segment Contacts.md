# **What is a Contact Type?**

  
Contact Type is a customizable dropdown field used to define the role or status of a contact in your system. It helps with segmentation, targeting, and automation. You can assign Contact Types manually or dynamically through workflows.  
  
When creating a new contact, Contact Type is a mandatory field, requiring the user to select from predefined dropdown values. Each contact can have only one Contact Type at a time, which makes this field ideal for high-level segmentation based on relationship status or lifecycle stage.
