# **What Are Contact Associations?**

  
Contact Associations enable structured relationships between contacts and objects in HighLevel CRM. Instead of managing disconnected profiles, associations provide clear connections between related entities, such as spouses, managers, employees, or linked objects.

  
#### **Types of Association Labels**

* **Single Label:** A label that applies to both contacts in the association (e.g., “Colleague”).
* **Pair Labels:** Distinct labels for each contact in the relationship (e.g., “Manager” and “Employee,” “Buyer” and “Seller”).

---

## **Key Benefits of Contact Associations**

  
* **Improved Contact Organization:** Associations provide a structured way to manage relationships between contacts, making it easier to track connections and access relevant information in one place.

  
* **Streamlined Communication:** By linking related contacts, businesses can quickly reference and reach out to connected individuals, ensuring smoother interactions and improved collaboration.

  
* **Enhanced Relationship Management:** Whether it’s family connections, business partnerships, or internal hierarchies, associations help businesses understand and manage relationships effectively.

  
* **Efficient CRM Workflow:** With clear associations in place, users can reduce duplicate data entry, quickly update linked contacts, and maintain a well-organized CRM system.

## **Where to View Contact Associations**

  
Contact associations can be accessed in two main areas:

  
* **Contact Profile View:** Within a contact’s profile, the right-side panel contains the Associations icon, which displays related objects and linked contacts.
