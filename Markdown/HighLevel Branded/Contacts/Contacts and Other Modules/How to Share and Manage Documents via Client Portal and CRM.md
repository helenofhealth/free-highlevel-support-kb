## **Overview**

  
This guide explains how CRM users share documents with contacts and how contacts upload files back through the Client Portal. You’ll learn where to find these tools and how to manage shared and received files efficiently.

Note: Documents and Contracts cannot be toggled to be shared or unshared at this time.

  
Prerequisites

This feature will only be available to contacts who are client portal users.

## **Why it Matters?** 

1. Centralized Files: All documents and uploads are managed in one place for clear visibility.
2. Seamless Collaboration: Streamlines file exchange between CRM users and clients without external tools.
3. Enhanced Control: Users and contacts can manage, preview, and revoke access with a click.
