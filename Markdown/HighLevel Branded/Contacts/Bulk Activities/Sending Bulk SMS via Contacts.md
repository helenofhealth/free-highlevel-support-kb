## **Frequently Asked Questions**

  
**Q: What happens if I don’t choose a phone number in the ‘From’ field?**

If no number is selected, the system defaults to the last number used per contact. If none exists, the account’s default number is used.

  
**Q: Can I cancel a scheduled bulk SMS after it’s queued?**

You cannot cancel a message that’s already sent, but you may be able to stop a scheduled or drip-based send by contacting support immediately after queuing.

  
**Q: How does drip mode handle timezones?**

Drip mode respects the local timezone of your account when processing time windows. All delays and send windows are calculated accordingly.

  
**Q: Will unsubscribed contacts still receive the bulk SMS?**

No, HighLevel automatically excludes unsubscribed or opted-out contacts from bulk sends to ensure compliance.

  
**Q: Can I track which contacts failed to receive the SMS and why?**

Yes. Go to the Bulk Actions tab > Show Stats. You’ll find detailed delivery reports including failure reasons like “invalid number” or “carrier block.”
