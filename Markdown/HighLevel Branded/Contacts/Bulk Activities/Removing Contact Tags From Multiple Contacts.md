# **What is Removing Tags from Multiple Contacts**

  
Removing tags in bulk allows you to clean up or reorganize contact data quickly. This is especially helpful when contact segmentation needs to be updated, campaigns have ended, or irrelevant tags are cluttering your CRM. Rather than editing each contact individually, bulk removal ensures swift and consistent updates.

## **Key Benefits of Removing Tags from Multiple Contacts**

  
Bulk tag removal streamlines CRM maintenance and ensures clean, accurate contact segmentation. Here’s why it’s valuable:

  
* Save time by removing tags from many contacts in one go
* Eliminate outdated or incorrect tags that impact automations
* Maintain a well-organized contact tagging structure
* Reduce confusion by clearing unused or overlapping labels
* Support accurate reporting by removing invalid groupings

### **Remove All Tags from Selected Contacts**

  
If you want to completely clear all tags from the selected contacts, check the **Remove all tags** box. This option removes every tag associated with those contacts—no need to specify which ones. It’s ideal for cleanup tasks or when you want to start fresh with a new tagging structure. Be sure you want to remove all tags before enabling this, as it clears everything in one go.

### **Select Tags to Remove**

  
Use the **Tags** dropdown to choose one or more tags you’d like to remove from the selected contacts. The list will show all existing tags, and you can scroll or search to find the right ones. This is helpful when you want to remove only specific tags while keeping others intact. Be sure not to select the **“Remove all tags”** checkbox if you only want to remove selected tags.
