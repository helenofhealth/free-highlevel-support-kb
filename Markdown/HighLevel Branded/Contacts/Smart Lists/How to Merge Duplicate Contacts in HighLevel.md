# **What is Merging Duplicate Contacts?**

  
Merging duplicate contacts in HighLevel allows you to **consolidate multiple records for the same individual or business into one unified contact**. This helps reduce confusion, eliminate redundant communications, and ensure a clean contact database. 

  
Duplicates can occur from manual entry, CSV imports, form submissions, or third-party integrations like Zapier. HighLevel identifies duplicates based on matching fields, such as names, emails, or phone numbers.

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

  
**Q: Can I merge contacts using the LeadConnector mobile app?**

Currently, the ability to merge contacts is not available in the LeadConnector mobile app. This feature is planned for release in Q3, along with additional bulk actions. In the meantime, you can merge contacts using the desktop version of HighLevel.

  
**Q. What happens to field data during a merge?**

The selected master record retains its details, while unique fields from other records are added to it.

  
**Q: Why don’t I see the “Merge Contacts” button?**

The “Merge Contacts” button only appears when you select 2 or more valid contacts (up to a maximum of 10). If the contacts you’re trying to merge are missing key fields (like a name, email, or phone number), the system may not allow a merge. Additionally, ensure that **1.** You have admin permissions to manage contacts. **2.** You’re selecting contacts from the same sub-account. **3.** Both contacts are visible in your contact list view (check filters).

  
**Q. Can I merge contacts in bulk?**

No, you can merge up to 10 contacts at a time. 

  
**Q: What causes duplicate contacts in HighLevel?** 

Duplicates can come from manual entry, CSV import, forms, or third-party tools like Zapier.

  
**Q: Will the contact's custom values or fields be affected?** 

Custom fields from the secondary contact will only be added if the corresponding field is blank in the primary. No overwriting will occur.

  
**Q: How do I know which contact to choose as the master?** 

Choose the record with the most accurate and up-to-date information. The master contact retains conversations, last activity, files, and other data.

  
**Q: Can HighLevel automatically find all duplicate contacts for me?**  
No. While you can manually search by name, phone, or email, HighLevel does not currently offer a full database scan for duplicates.

  
**Q: How do I prevent duplicates from form or calendar submissions?**  
Make sure “Allow Duplicate Contacts” is turned off in your deduplication settings.
