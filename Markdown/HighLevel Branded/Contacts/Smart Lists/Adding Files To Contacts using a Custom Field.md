## **Why Add Files to Contacts?**

  
Adding files to contacts in GoHighLevel allows you to store important documents directly within the contact profile, such as contracts, invoices, and notes. This feature streamlines client management by keeping all essential files organized and easily accessible.

  
**HighLevel provides two methods to upload files to a contact:**

  
1. Directly via the contact profile.
2. Using a custom field for file uploads.

## **Key Considerations Before Creating a Custom Field**

  
When setting up a custom file upload field in GoHighLevel, you have several important options to configure for better organization and functionality. These options determine how the field behaves, where it appears, and what type of files it can handle.

  
| **Field**                | **What It Does**                                                                                                    | **Details and Examples**                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **File Type**            | Specifies the types of files users can upload through this custom field.                                            | Supported formats: **PDF, DOC/DOCX, JPG/JPEG, PNG, GIF, XLS/CSV.** This ensures only compatible files are accepted.                                                                                                 |
| **File Restriction**     | Sets the maximum file size allowed for uploads.                                                                     | Maximum size per file: **250MB**. Ensure users are aware of this limit to avoid errors during uploads.                                                                                                              |
| **Allow Multiple Files** | Defines whether users can upload a single file or multiple files.                                                   | **Single File:** Restrict to one file for simplicity.**Multiple Files:** Specify the maximum number of files (e.g., 3 or 5).                                                                                        |
| **Object Type**          | Determines the category where the custom field will be applied.                                                     | **Contact:** Attach files to individual contact profiles.**Opportunity:** Link files to deals or leads.**Company:** Associate files with company profiles.**Surfboards:** Customize for your unique business needs. |
| **Group Tab**            | Organizes the custom field within a specific section or grouping in the system for better visibility and usability. | Examples:**Contact Information:** Core details like personal documents.**General Info:** Miscellaneous files.**Additional Info:** Supplementary or secondary documents.                                             |
| **Save the Field**       | Finalizes the creation process, making the field available for use.                                                 | Once saved, this field will appear in the **Custom Fields Section** of the selected object (e.g., contact profile).                                                                                                 |

## **Upload Files to a Contact Using a Custom Field**

  
In HighLevel, the ability to upload files to a contact is only available after creating a custom field of the **File Upload** type. Once the custom field is created, you can navigate to the contact's profile to upload, view, or delete files directly within the designated field.

  
### **Step 1:** Create a Custom Field Called File Upload

  
A custom field must be created as it is not available by default; only after creating it can the field be seen and used under the Contact section.

  
Go to **Settings** from the left-hand menu and select **Custom Fields,** then **c**lick the **Add Custom Field** button. Choose the **File Upload** field type from the available options. Give the field a descriptive name (e.g., "Contract Upload" or "Client Document") and finally save the custom field.

### **Step 2:** Add a File to a Contact

  
Once the custom field is created, follow these steps to upload a file to a contact. If you have multiple custom fields created, search the Custom Field inside the Group Tab. 

  
Go to the **Contacts** section from the left-hand menu and select the contact you want to update. In the **Custom Fields Section** of the contact's profile, locate the file upload field you created.

### **Step 3:** Upload a File

  
Once the custom field is visible in the Contact's profile, you can upload the desired file directly into the field by selecting and confirming the file from your device.

  
Scroll to the **Custom Fields** section of the contact's profile and locate the file upload field you created earlier. Click **Upload File** and select a file from your device and confirm the upload to store the file within the contact's profile.

After uploading a file to the custom field, you can **Manage** it directly from the Contactâ€™s profile. To **View** the file, simply click on the file link in the custom field to open and review it. If you need to **Delete** a file, it can be removed from the field or replaced by uploading a new one. In case of accidental deletion, an **Undo** option will appear immediately, allowing you to restore the file quickly and effortlessly.
