## **How to Filter Contacts by Age in Smart Lists**

  
Using the Birthday field, you can segment your contacts based on their age for targeted communication.

  
### **Steps to Filter by Age**

1. Go to **Contacts** \> **Smart Lists**.
2. Apply a **Filter** using the Birthday field's **Age** condition.
3. Select the appropriate comparison:

| Filter Condition       | Use Case Example                              |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Age is greater than X  | Target seniors aged 50+                       |
| Age is less than X     | Promotions for young audiences under 25       |
| Age is between X and Y | Target specific age groups, e.g., 30â€“40 years |

The system calculates age dynamically based on the current date and the stored birthday.

## **Best Practices**

  
* **Capture Birthdays Early**: Include a Birthday field in lead capture forms to gather the information upfront.
* **Validate Date Formats**: Use MM/DD/YYYY format to ensure automation triggers work correctly.
* **Test Automation**: Always test birthday workflows with sample contacts before making them live.
* **Consider Time Zones**: Be aware that workflows may use contact-specific time zones if configured.
