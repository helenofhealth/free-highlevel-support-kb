# General Questions

## Why do I need to confirm my contacts have consented to hear from me while importing contacts?

Two main reasons why the consent from contacts is helpful while importing contacts:

* **Protect Your Sending Reputation: I**mporting bulk contacts without proper consent can lead to higher bounce and spam rates, negatively impacting your sending reputation.
* **Prevent Issues with Purchased or Rented Lists:** Even if some lists claim to have opt-in consent, they may not be suitable for marketing communication tools. Contacts from purchased or rented sources are likely to bounce, unsubscribe, mark emails as spam, and may cause blocklistings.

  
## What are the different bulk actions that cannot be restored?

The following bulk actions cannot be restored:

* Bulk Email
* Bulk Email Verification
* Bulk Update Contacts to Company
* Bulk Tag Add
* Bulk SMS
