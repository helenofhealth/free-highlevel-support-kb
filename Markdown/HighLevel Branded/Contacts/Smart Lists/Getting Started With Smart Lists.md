## **What are Smart Lists?**

  
A **Smart List** is a **dynamic contact list** in HighLevel that updates automatically based on predefined filters and conditions. Unlike **static lists**, which remain unchanged unless manually updated, **Smart Lists** continuously adjust as new contacts meet (or no longer meet) the specified criteria. It allows users to customize and filter contacts based on specific conditions, such as custom fields. You can select which columns to display, and the Smart Lists update in real-time as contact data changes.

  
This feature can be found under the **Subaccount → Contacts tab → Smartlists**

## **How Do Smart Lists Work?**

  
* **Real-Time Updates:** Contacts are automatically added or removed based on filters like tags, custom fields, engagement activity, or opportunity stages.
* **Automated Segmentation:** Easily create lists of leads, active customers, or prospects without manual updates.
* **Advanced Filtering:** Smart Lists allow you to apply multiple filters simultaneously (e.g., "Opened an email in the last 30 days" + "Has an open invoice").
* **Workflow Integration:** Smart Lists can trigger automated workflows, ensuring **personalized engagement at scale**.

## **Setting Up Smart Lists**

  
Creating a Smart List in HighLevel is a simple process that allows you to automatically segment contacts based on specific criteria. Instead of manually updating lists, Smart Lists ensure your contact groups stay organized and updated in real-time. Follow these steps to create your first Smart List:

  
1. Go to Contacts > Contacts/Smart Lists and hit "More Filters."
2. Pick one or multiple filters from the dropdown menu on the right side of your screen.
3. After choosing a filter, input the necessary details and click “Apply” to secure your filter.
4. To add more filters, select the “AND” option.
5. To permanently save your filter(s) as a list, click “Save as smart list” at the bottom of your screen.

## **Managing Smart Lists**

  
Smart Lists can be modified, filtered, and managed to better align with your business needs. You can apply different filters, adjust conditions, or even duplicate existing lists for more refined segmentation.

  
1. To access your Smart Lists, go to the Contacts section and select a Smart List name from the top to open it.
2. If you want to modify an existing Smart List, open it, and you'll see the saved filters for that list on the right-hand side.
3. Select the trash can icon or the X. To modify a filter, click the pencil icon or the dropdown arrow to remove a filter. Use the Save icon to store your changes.
4. You can manage your Smart Lists by navigating to "Manage Smart Lists" at the top right of the Contacts page. This area lets you **duplicate, share, rename, or erase/delete** a SmartList using the icons on the right.

## **Frequently Asked Questions** 

  
**Q: Can I manually add existing contacts to an existing Smart List?**

No, contacts are not manually added to Smart Lists. They are added automatically based on the filters and conditions set for that Smart List. If you add a tag to a contact that matches a filter condition for a Smart List, they will automatically be added to that Smart List.
  
  
**Q Can users manage smart lists without having 'settings' access?**

Users cannot manage their smart lists without having 'settings' access. This issue has been added to HighLevel's roadmap for future updates.
  
  
**Q: Is there a way to see who created and shared a smart list?**

HighLevel does not log information about who created and shared a smart list.
  
  
**Q: Can all users see Smart Lists or just the user that created them?**

Smart Lists are created at the user level, not at the location level. However, with "global versus local" Smart Lists, users can now push their Smart Lists to the full account, making them visible to all users.
  
  
**Q: Can Smart Lists be transferred between accounts or moved into a snapshot?**

As of the time of writing, no feature allows moving Smart Lists from one account to another or importing them into a snapshot.
  
  
**Q: Can Smart Lists be shared with others?**

Yes, you can share Smart Lists. Go to 'Manage Smart Lists' and click the 'share' button to do this.
