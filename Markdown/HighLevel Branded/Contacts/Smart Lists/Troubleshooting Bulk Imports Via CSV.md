## **Frequently Asked Questions**

  
**Q: What file type should I upload?**

Only .csv files are accepted. If you’re working in Excel or Google Sheets, export your data as a CSV file first.
  
  
**Q: Can I undo a bulk import?**

While there’s no direct “undo” option, you can tag imported contacts during upload. Use that tag to filter and delete if necessary.
  
  
**Q: What is the maximum file size for import?**

The limit is 20MB or 10,000 rows—whichever comes first.
  
  
**Q: How can I validate phone numbers before uploading?**

Use spreadsheet formulas or online tools to ensure they follow the E.164 format.
  
  
**Q: What should I choose as the Primary Column?**

Use a unique identifier like Email or Contact ID that won’t repeat across multiple contacts.
  
  
**Q. My CSV list is mixed; some contacts have an email or phone #, and some have both an email and phone. How should I proceed?**

Please use the 'secondary preference' option for a mixed CSV. The system will search for the first preference and then the second if it cannot locate the first. In the example above the first preference is 'Email' and the second is 'Phone'.

  
Now we can find existing contacts based on the secondary field, so if the contact record has only the phone number, we can also upload them!

**Q. Some of my contacts have multiple emails and or phone numbers. How should I proceed?**

If a contact has multiple phone numbers or emails, please split the contact into multiple so they will be uploaded. Example:

  
**Original with two phone number columns:**

| --------- | ------------ | ------------ | ------------------------------ |

  
**Cleaned for upload version:**

| Josephine | 810-374-9840 |                                |

  
Keep the email blank for the second lead with a different phone number because it will create duplicates when we upload contacts with phone numbers as the unique field.

  
**Q. Important note for people that use Keap:**

The phone field from the CSV export in Keap is incompatible with GHL. The parenthesis '()' and dashes '-' make it incompatible. We have to highlight the entire column in the CSV file and ensure it is numbered in, remove any parentheses and dashes, and then we can import without corrupting the data in the CRM. 
  
  
**Q. When importing the phone numbers, I get the error code 1007 'invalid required property':**

Add a country code for numbers outside the sub-account country when importing numbers. If the sub-account country is set to the **US**, you **won't need** to add a **+1** (US country code) to the imported phone numbers. However, if you're importing numbers **outside of the US**, you will need to add the **[country code](https://countrycode.org/)**   
  
**I.e.,** Asub-account that has set its business location to the **US**would need to add **'+44** to call the UK. If the Sub-Accounts country is set to a different country other than the **US** (like the UK, Australia, etc.), to call/SMS US numbers, you would need to add a **'** **+1 to the country's area code within the CSV File.**

**Q. I'm trying to import a CSV with a DND Column, but all contacts are set to DND for ALL channels.**

When importing contacts with a DND column within your CSV, please note that the contacts will be DND for ALL the channels. If you want to DND for specific channels, please set up a workflow first and use tags for each channel. 

  
**I.e.,** I would like John to be DND for SMS only. I would create a workflow that DNDs a contact when a tag 'DND SMS' is added. So now, on the CSV, I would add the Tag 'DND SMS' next to John's name. When importing, this would fire automation to DND John for SMS only. 
  
  
**Q. I'm trying to import a CSV with Notes, and I cannot generate more than one note per contact record.**

When importing contact notes, you may only have one note per contact record with a limit of **5000** **characters**. Please use the [large text custom field](https://help.gohighlevel.com/en/support/solutions/articles/48001161579) if you have more than one note or more characters than the allowed amount.
  
  
**Q. I'm trying to export a CSV with Notes.** 

As of now, We do not have any limit for CSV import for notes, and as per our current export behavior, we support Max of 255 Characters for the last note.
