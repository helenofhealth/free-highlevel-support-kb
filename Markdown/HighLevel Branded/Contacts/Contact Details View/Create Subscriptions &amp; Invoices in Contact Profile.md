# **Frequently Asked Questions**

  
**Q: What happens if a customer’s payment method fails during subscription setup?**

If a payment method fails, the system will prompt you to select an alternate card or add a new one. The subscription will not be activated until a valid payment method is added.
  
  
**Q: Can I create multiple subscriptions for the same customer?**

Yes, you can create multiple subscriptions for a single customer. Each subscription can have its own products, billing dates, and payment methods.
