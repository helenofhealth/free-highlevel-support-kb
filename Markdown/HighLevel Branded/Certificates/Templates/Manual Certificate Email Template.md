# What is the Manual Certificate Email Template Feature?

The Manual Certificate Email Template feature allows users to choose from existing email templates when sending certificates manually. Additionally, users can customize the subject line for these emails before sending. This ensures the communication is aligned with the event, audience, or branding requirements.

If a user does not select a template during this process, the system will default to the template configured in the client portalâ€™s email settings.

## Key Benefits of Manual Certificate Email Templates

Choosing specific templates for manual certificate emails enhances clarity, branding, and engagement. This section highlights the main advantages of using this feature.

* Personalize certificate delivery with custom templates.
* Customize the subject line to align with the content or event.
* Maintain consistent branding across all communications.
* Reuse templates to save time and reduce manual editing.
* Avoid mistakes with a fallback default template when none is selected.

## How To Send a Manual Certificate With a Selected Email Template

Selecting a predefined email template when sending a certificate manually ensures the message is appropriate and professionally formatted. Follow the steps below to use this feature:

1. Navigate to the Certificates section within your HighLevel account.
2. Select the contact(s) for whom you wish to send a certificate.
3. Click Send Certificate.
4. In the email modal, locate the Email Template dropdown.
5. Select the desired email template from the list.
