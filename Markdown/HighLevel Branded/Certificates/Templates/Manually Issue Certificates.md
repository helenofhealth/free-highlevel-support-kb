We're excited to introduce a new feature: **Offline Certificates**. This functionality allows you to send certificates manually to any contact, making it easier to manage certifications for testing purposes or for courses not hosted on HighLevel. Whether you're conducting offline training or wish to issue certificates for external courses, this feature offers a seamless way to acknowledge your learners' achievements.
