## ⭐️ Overview

Badges are a lightweight, visual way to recognise milestones, progress, and engagement. While we’re actively working on a dedicated **“Issue Badge”** action, you can start issuing badges **right now** using the existing **“Issue Certificate”** workflow action.

Yes — **Badges are issued through the same action as Certificates**!

---

## ⚙️ How It Works

You can combine any of the supported **workflow triggers** with the existing **“Issue Certificate”** action to send a **Badge** automatically to your customers.

> ✅ Just select a **Badge template** instead of a Certificate when using the "Issue Certificate" action.

## Most Used Triggers + Use Cases

| **Workflow Trigger**   | **Badge Use Cases (Example)** |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| **Lesson Completed**   | "Lesson 1 Complete" Badge     |
| **Category Completed** | "Module Master" Badge         |
| **Product Completed**  | "Certified Pro" Badge         |
| **Quiz Submitted**     | "Quiz Ace" Badge              |

| **Form Submitted**     | "Quick Action Taker" Badge    |

You can find these triggers inside your **Workflow Trigger menu**, under “Courses,” “Contact,” and “Form Activities.”

## How to Set It Up?

1. Go to **Automation** \> **Workflows**
2. **Create from Scratch** or open an existing Workflow
3. Add a **Trigger** from the list above

## ⏳ Coming Soon

We’re introducing a **dedicated “Issue Badge” action** to make this even clearer and easier to use. Until then, the **“Issue Certificate”** action supports both **Badges** and **Certificates** seamlessly.
