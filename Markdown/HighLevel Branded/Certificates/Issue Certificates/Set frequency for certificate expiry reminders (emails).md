**Overview:** With the latest update, you can now customize the number of days before an expiry date to receive reminder emails. This feature replaces the default intervals of 2 and 7 days before expiry, giving you greater control over when you receive important notifications.

**Key Benefits:**

* Customize reminder intervals based on your preferences.
* Ensure timely notifications that align with your schedule.
* Stay in control of expiry reminders for a better user experience.

**How to Set Custom Expiry Reminder Intervals:**

1. **Access Your Account Settings:**  
   * Log in to your account.  
   * Navigate to the **Certificates section under membership**
2. **Edit Reminder Preferences for Certificate Templates-**  
   * **Adding an expiry date to a template would mean that everyone who receives the certificate, it will expire on the same date.**  
   * Locate the certificate template wherein you want to add expiry option.  
   * Click **3 dots > Set Expiry and choose a relevant date** to modify your preferences.  
   * For a selected date, you can choose whether you want 2 reminder emails to go out or 1 and toggle them on/off.  
   * **Add all relevant days for each reminder email. All emails will be sent out after the number of days that are added.**  
   * **The same can be done for all certificates under Issued certificate tab for individual level customisation.**  
         
   **Note: Only certificate expired email will go out on the day of expiry when Immediately is selected**
