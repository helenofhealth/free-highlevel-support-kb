# **What Is Dashboard Duplication?**

  
Dashboards are created and exist inside a subaccount. You can [clone a dashboard](https://help.gohighlevel.com/en/support/solutions/articles/155000001534) to make a copy in the same subaccount, or you can **duplicate** a dashboard to make a copy in a **different subaccount**.

  
You must have access to both subaccounts to duplicate dashboards between them.

**Data sources will not be duplicated**. If the original dashboard widgets pull data from custom values then the duplicate dashboard will have **red widgets** that need to be deleted or connected to appropriate data sources.

## **Duplicate A Dashboard**

  
### **Step 1: Duplicate To Another Sub-account**

  
Navigate to Subaccount > Dashboard > action menu (3-dots), and click the Duplicate to another sub-account button.

### **Step 2: Configure and Save**

  
In the Duplicate to another sub-account modal, type the name of the new dashboard, select the target subaccount, and click the duplicate button. This will create the new dashboard in the target subaccount.

### **Step 3: Connect Broken Data Sources**

  
If the widgets in the dashboard use data sources that do not exist in the target subaccount then those widgets will show with red borders and the error message: "error while loading data". Delete the widgets or connect them to an appropriate data source.
