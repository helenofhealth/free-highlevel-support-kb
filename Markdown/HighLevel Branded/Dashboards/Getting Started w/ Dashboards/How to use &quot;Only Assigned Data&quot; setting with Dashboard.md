### **Why and How to Use "Only Assigned Data" with Dashboards**

#### **Use Cases and Benefits:**

* **Enhanced Security:** By limiting data visibility, sensitive information is protected from unauthorized access, ensuring that only relevant team members can view specific data.
* **Improved Efficiency:** This feature automatically filters dashboard widgets to display data pertinent to the user without the need for manual filtering. This reduces setup time and allows users to focus on their tasks.
* **Simplified Workflow:** The system automatically restricts widget data, preventing users from seeing information that isnâ€™t relevant to their role. This results in a more organized and user-friendly dashboard experience

#### **Examples of Use:**

* **Sales Teams:** Sales managers can ensure that sales representatives only see their own leads and opportunities, preventing data overlap and enhancing focus.
* **Customer Success:** Team members can be restricted to viewing only their assigned customers, calls, or appointments, leading to faster response times.

**Please Note:**
If a widget has a hardcoded filter for another team member, users with "Only Assigned Data" enabled will see a permission-required message.![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155031956659/original/3ufH1rFc8Y1EIqRBlhIcAosT4PAYHqa1GA.png?1725016627)
