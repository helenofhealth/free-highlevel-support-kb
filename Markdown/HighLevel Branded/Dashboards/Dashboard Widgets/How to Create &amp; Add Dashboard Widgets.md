![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155037159247/original/KE13mXOL9cjwyFQDs2Tcf8vy6vpfQRS8Qw.png?1732542169)  

Next, choose whether the dashboard is Private (visible only to you) or For Everyone (visible to all users in the sub-account).

If this is supposed to be a shared dashboard, you can control how you would like the team members to access the dashboard data. You can choose to grant Full access, Edit access, only View access or No access to your Agency users, Agency admins and for a Sub-account admin.

Step 3: Open the Widget Menu

To add a widget, click the Add Widget button. If you're here to create the widgets inside the existing Dashboard then you can click the pencil icon at the top right corner. This opens the widget menu on the right-hand side of the screen.

Step 4: Choose the Chart Type and Widget Category  
Select the type of widget you want to add by browsing the categories or using the search bar to find a specific widget.

  
1\. Select the chart type for the data to be displayed. You can choose from different chart types such as Numeric, Donut Chart, Line Chart, Bar Chart, Horizontal Bar Chart, and Table chart.

Step 5: Customize Your Widget

In the Widget Settings panel:

1. Chart Type Selection: Choose how you want your data to be visualized. The chart type selector is now built into the widget settings for quicker access.
2. Title and Description: Optionally add a name and short description for the widget.![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155047729821/original/x5azwM8ezPpKcXcQD6pFebnDz0EusTzd_w.png?1749034674)

Step 6: Apply Filters

Switch to the Conditions tab to apply filters to your widget data:

1. Click “Add Filter” to create your first group of filters.
2. Use “+AND” to keep adding more filters within the same group.
3. Click “+Add Filter” again to start a new group. This will create an OR condition between the groups.
4. You can now reuse the same filter (e.g., "Session Source") in different groups.

**Important Note (Attribution Fields)**  
If you're using **attribution fields** like **Session Source** or **Session Medium** in the **Group By** or **View By** dropdown (e.g., for donut or line charts):  
* Only one compound filter group allowed  
* That single filter group **must** include the **Attribution Type** (either _First Touch_ or _Last Touch_) as a filter.  
* If multiple filter groups are added, attribution-based fields (Session Source / Medium) will be **disabled** in the dropdown.  
This limitation ensures data consistency when working with attribution metrics.![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155048128120/original/mWxpKprItbrJ9rVD3KRH2VMQv9aRh-N0xg.png?1749715080)

Step 7: Save 

Once everything’s set up, click Save to add the widget to your dashboard.

  
Step 8: Add More Widgets

To build a complete picture of your data, repeat the process to add more widgets. For example:  
  
Step 9: Organize Your Widgets

Once your widgets are added, you can resize and reposition them to suit your needs. Drag and drop widgets into place and adjust their size for better visibility.

Step 10: Save Changes

After organizing your widgets, Click Save Changes at the top of the dashboard. This ensures your new setup is saved and ready for use.
