The "Duplicate Widget" feature allows you to easily copy existing widgets on your dashboard. This helps save time, especially when creating widgets with similar configurations. Instead of building a new widget from scratch, you can duplicate an existing one, make minor adjustments, and save it as a new widget.

  
This feature is perfect for users who frequently work with complex or repetitive widgets, streamlining their workflow and increasing efficiency.
