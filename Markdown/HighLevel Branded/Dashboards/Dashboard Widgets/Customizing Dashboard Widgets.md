What Are Dashboard Widgets?

Dashboard widgets are small, interactive tools that present key data points in visual formats like charts, graphs, and tables. These widgets are essential for summarizing complex information into easy-to-read formats. Customizing them allows you to tailor their appearance and functionality, ensuring they align perfectly with your reporting needs.  
  
  
## Why Should You Customize Dashboard Widgets?

Customizing widgets offers several benefits:

  
 **• Personalized Insights:** Highlight the metrics most relevant to your business goals.

**• Enhanced Clarity:** Adjust titles, filters, and layouts to make data interpretation straightforward.

**• Improved Comparisons:** Add filters and conditions to compare different metrics or time periods easily.

**• Efficiency:** Quickly access the data you need without navigating through irrelevant information.

  
## Where to Find the Widget Customization Options

 1\. Navigate to your dashboard within the platform.

 2\. Choose the widget you want to modify from the list.

 3\. Click on the widget to access the configuration and customization options.
