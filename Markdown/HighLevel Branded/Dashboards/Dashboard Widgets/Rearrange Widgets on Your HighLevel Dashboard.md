## **Frequently Asked Questions**

  
**Q: Will my widget rearrangement affect other users?**  
Typically, changes apply only to your personal dashboard view. If you're an admin, you may have the option to set a global layout for all users.

  
**Q: What happens if I move a widget to the wrong spot?**  
You can simply drag the widget again to reposition it. All changes are flexible while you're in Edit Mode and arenâ€™t saved until you exit or save.
