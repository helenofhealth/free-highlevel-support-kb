### **Question: Why is HighLevel charging me Sales & Use tax?**

**Answer: HighLevel has recently completed a Nexus Study. As a result, some of our products and services are considered taxable. This is a result of the [2018 ruling in South Dakota v. Wayfair](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/17pdf/17-494%5Fj4el.pdf), a landmark Sales & Use tax nexus case which changed the rules on physical and economic nexus.**
