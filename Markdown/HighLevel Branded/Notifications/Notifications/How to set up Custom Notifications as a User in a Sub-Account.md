## **Frequently Asked Questions**

  
**Q: How does the “Mark all as read” button work?**

It changes all current notifications from unread to read status for the logged-in user.

  
**Q: Why do I receive duplicate notifications for the same message?**

This happens when multiple triggers apply (e.g., “assigned to me” + “new message”). Review your notification settings and disable overlapping options for a cleaner inbox.

  
**Q: What does the “Clear All” button do?**

It removes all current notifications from view. New notifications will still populate after clicking the button. Cleared notifications cannot be restored.
