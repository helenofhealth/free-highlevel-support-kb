# **A**

## A2P 10 DLC

(Technical Jargon Abbreviation) Application-to-Person (A2P) type messaging via standard 10-digit long code (10 DLC) 

  
## A Record 

An A record maps a domain to the physical IP address of the computer hosting that domain. Internet traffic uses the A record to find the computer hosting your domain's DNS settings. The value of an A record is always an IP address, and multiple A records can be configured for one domain name.

  
## Affiliate 

An affiliate is a person or organization officially attached to a larger organization. As an agency-level user, you are an affiliate of HighLevel and can refer others to the HighLevel software through an affiliate link to gain your own affiliates. If the referral purchases the software, then you earn a commission for that referral. For more information about the affiliate program, please visit the Solutions page in the HighLevel Support Portal.

  
## Agency View

The first view that Agency Users see when they login to the platform. This view is where Agencies will manage system-wide settings and communicate with HighLevel. Agencies can use this level to access the Marketplace, Ideas board, University courses, and Support. All other features are at the sub-account level.

  
## API

(Technical Jargon Abbreviation) Application Programming Interface

  
## API Key

API keys are used to make secure connections between 2 platforms without the need to log in each time the connection needs to be made. An API key is often needed to set up Mailgun or SMTP services or create integrations with platforms not already created within the Highlevel platform.

  
## Automations (Aut)

Automation is a series of events set off by a specific action. You might imagine a series of dominos all set up to fall over in sequence when a ball rolls to hit the first one. In this same way, automation can be set up to fire off any series of messages, and back-end processes after a contact does a certain activity (i.e., submitting a form or booking an appointment). Includes: Workflows, Campaigns, Triggers."

# **C**

## Calendar (Cal)

The calendar feature replaces the need for an external booking widget. Customers often try to get their leads on calls to discuss tactics, do demonstrations, or provide services. The team's calendars can allow a single user to offer multiple appointment types(i.e., spas, and salons) or for multiple users to get round-robin assigned to the same type of appointment (i.e., sales calls).

  
## Calendar>Appointments Per Day 

The appointments per day refer to the total number of appointments that can be booked on a single day. For example, if there are 30-minute appointment slots in an 8-hour day, that's 16 appointments per day. That may not be desired, so setting a number of appointments per day will limit the number of appointments to that number on a daily basis.

  
## Calendar>Appointments Per Slot

The appointments per slot refer to the number of people who can book an appointment. Normally, this is kept at 1 unless a multiperson event such as a webinar exists.

  
## Calendar>Buffer Duration

Buffer Duration determines how frequently appointments can be booked in relation to each other by adding a buffer time after every appointment. For example, if an appointment slot duration is 30 minutes and is set for 10 AM with a buffer of 15 minutes, the very next appointment time would be 10:45 AM.

  
## Calendar>Date Range

The date range refers to how far in advance an appointment can be booked.  
  
## Calendar>Minimum Scheduling Notice 

The minimum scheduling notice is the minimum amount of time an appointment must be booked ahead of the requested appointment.  
  
## Calendar>Slot Duration

Slot Duration determines the length of the appointment.

  
## Calendar>Slot Interval

Slot Interval determines how frequently the appointments are available.

##   

## Campaign 

A campaign refers to the software portion where you will set up various online avenues to promote your products and services.

  
## Chat Widget 

A pop-up can be placed on a website to gather contact info and create a conversation for the contact. Think of it as a sophisticated contact us form since there is no two-way chatting on this feature. All follow-ups will be done over the phone or by email.

  
## CNAME Record 

A Canonical Name or CNAME record is a type of DNS (Domain Name System) record that maps an alias name to a true or canonical domain name. In other words, it's the "master version" of a page on your website that you want search engine crawlers to find. As you launch marketing campaigns and track users, information gets added to the end of your unique page URLs. From the crawlers’ point of view, this means you have multiple versions of the same page without a clear indication of which one is "right." When you set up a canonical URL in the page's HTML, you tell search engines which version of the page you want visitors to see.

  
## Company 

The company is the place where you can make changes to the client's business information.

  
## Contact (aka Lead) 

A profile of an individual who can be tracked on the platform. Typically, the profile includes the name, contact methods, additional info about the individual, a history of activity, and appointments booked. Conversations can also be held on the contact profile. (See also Lead)

##   

## Conversations (Convo)

Many companies have a presence across many communication channels (i.e., SMS, email, Facebook messenger). The conversations area allows users to see all the messages from the lead regardless of the platform or contact method. This means customers no longer have to flip through multiple tabs and applications to track what was said to the lead.

  
## Conversion Leads

Facebook conversion leads integration helps your Facebook lead ads optimize for the quality of leads instead of the volume of leads. When users submit the lead form, their contact information is captured and synced in Highlevel's CRM. This contact information can then be used to follow up with the leads to nurture them and move them further down the sales funnel. As each Lead moves through the sales funnel, the conversion leads integration allows the advertiser to share the lead status with Meta, which allows Meta to optimize the lead ad for increased lead-to-sales conversion.

  
## CRM

(Technical Jargon Abbreviation) Customer Relationship Management. The CRM is the list of contacts in the system and the tools you have to interact with them. We provide options to book appointments, send them communication, and maintain data about each individual.

## CSS

(Technical Jargon Abbreviation) Cascading Style Sheets

  
## CSV

(Technical Jargon Abbreviation) Comma-separated values

  
## Custom CSS (aka Custom Coding) 

CSS coding can be used to modify the appearance of the platform. HTML coding can be used to modify the functionality of the platform. We typically do not do builds or provide support for any custom coding, but we have several partners that can provide these services.

# **D**

## Dashboard, Agency 

The Dashboard at the Agency level shows Stripe revenue. It is meant to be a quick snapshot to show agencies what they have earned from building their business with HighLevel. This area will show more features in the future, much like the Sub-Account dashboards do now. There are no settings to change or modify the dashboard, so users must use custom coding to add additional features.
  
  
## Dashboard, Sub-Account 

The Dashboard in the Sub-Account displays graphics and metrics based on the pipeline as well as some quick looks at daily activities. Users will see the full potential value of all the pipelines, the distribution of contacts across each platform, and see the count of opportunities from each source. Note: The lead source widget looks at the opportunity source separate from the Contact Source. Users can also quickly access their manual actions and tasks within the dashboard.

  
## DB

(Commonly Used Abbreviation) Database

  
## DKIM

(Technical Jargon Abbreviation) Domain Keys Identified Mail

  
## DMARC

(Technical Jargon Abbreviation) Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting, and Conformance

  
## DNS 

(Technical Jargon Abbreviation) Simply put, Domain Name System (DNS) is the internet's phone book. The system converts website domain names (hostnames) into numerical values (IP address), so they can be found and loaded into your web browser.

  
## Domains 

A domain is a part of the web address nomenclature someone would use to find your website or a page of your website online. It is a string of text associated with the numerical IP address of a website that's much easier for people to remember and search. A domain is often compared to a home address. Your friends don't memorize your house's GSP coordinates whenever they want to visit you. Instead, they plug in your street address into their phones. The same goes for visiting a website. Instead of memorizing a website's IP address, visitors type in the domain into their browser.

  
## Drip Mode 

Drip Mode is a feature that allows you to send the email campaign in timed batches rather than to your whole audience simultaneously. This helps control traffic to your websites or funnels and prevents potential tension on your server.

# **E**

## Eliza 

Eliza Agent Platform is the AI Chat Bot offered by HighLevel and our partners. The idea is that the bot can be placed on a website where a customer can chat and converse with a bot to get most of their questions answered. If, at any point, the bot does not understand how to respond, a human rollover feature will kick in, and one of our partners will take over the chat from there. The agent will then teach the bot how to respond in the future so that Eliza continues to grow to provide the most accurate answers. There is a monthly cost to the service.

Leads can come from website users who complete a contact form, trade show attendees who provide contact information in person, or lists you purchase from another company, such as a list broker. Sales and marketing professionals further vet, or “qualify,” leads to prioritize their fit with the company’s buyer profiles.

  
## Lead Events

The LeadConnector CRM sends the events with how the Lead moves across the pipeline stages. For example, a Business creates a pipeline name Lead Generation.

## Snapshot

Snapshots are copies of a particular sub-account at a particular point in time.

Snapshots are used to drastically reduce the amount of time an agency would need to set up sub-accounts so their customers can quickly start using the product.
