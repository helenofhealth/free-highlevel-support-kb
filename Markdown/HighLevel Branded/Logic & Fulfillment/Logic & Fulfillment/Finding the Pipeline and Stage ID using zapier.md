If you do not wish to use Zapier for Stage ID and Pipeline ID, in HighLevel the only way to get that information is by exporting opportunities.

  
**IMPORTANT**: This article only provides guidance for finding the Pipeline and Stage ID using Zapier.  
We do not support other third-party platforms or integrations for this purpose.  
The steps outlined are specifically intended for use with Zapier only.
  
  
**IMPORTANT**: Stage name is enough to create opportunities so we dont really need the Stage ID anymore.
