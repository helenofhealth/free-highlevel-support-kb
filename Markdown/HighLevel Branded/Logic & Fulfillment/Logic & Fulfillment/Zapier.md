**Note**: The HighLevel Zapier integration is now listed in Zapier as "LeadConnector".
  
  
**Please note:** 

In this video around the **4:10-4:15 mins** mark, I said "new agency account" by mistake. I meant new subaccount for your agency.Â 

The "**add account**" option (**2:35secs**) has been removed from LeadConnector. To create subaccounts via API please [see this guide](https://help.gohighlevel.com/en/support/solutions/articles/48001207048)
