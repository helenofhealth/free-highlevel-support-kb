A sub-account transfer is the movement of a sub-account from one Agency (Releasing Agency) to another Agency (Receiving Agency). It is not a merge, we cannot merge the data of one sub-account and put it in another, nor can we transfer the sub-account partially (some data not other).

## **Phone Number Transfers**

* A2P DLC status will be retained. Sub-accounts do not need to again register the phone numbers that are already registered.
* All the phone usage charges going forward will be accrued by the receiving agency.

  
**Both Agencies are not on LeadConnector (Either one or Both are Twilio)**

No phone numbers will be transferred over by HighLevel. It is your responsibility to work with the previous account owner as well as Twilio to move over any or all phone numbers that you may want to keep connected to the transferred sub-account.

   * The ON/OFF state of email verification is preserved during the transfer.
* LC Status After Transfer:

**If the sub-account is in a non-LC agency (using own email service):**

* Mailgun (Own or Inherited):
* Any Mailgun account (sub-account or agency-provided) will be deleted, and the sub-account will use the default email provider of the new agency.

* Similarly, any SMTP configuration will be removed, and the sub-account will adopt the SMTP/email provider set by the new agency.

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

  
**Q: Can I merge one Sub-Account with another?**

No. Sub-Account transfers are a movement of the entire sub-account, not a movement of just the data inside of it. This movement takes place from one agency to another.

**Q: What is the prep that I have to do to the sub-account before transferring?**

* Set all users that you want to be transferred over are User Type ‘Account’ and only assigned to this specific sub-account being transferred.
* Any SaaS sub-account will need to have SaaS disabled.
* All active subscriptions like Wordpress, Listings, Whatsapp, Dedicated IP etc. will have to be cancelled before the transfer is requested.

**Q: What is the setup that I will need once the transfer is made?**

* You will need to reconnect all auth connections (ex: Google, FB, Quickbooks, Clio, DrChrono)
