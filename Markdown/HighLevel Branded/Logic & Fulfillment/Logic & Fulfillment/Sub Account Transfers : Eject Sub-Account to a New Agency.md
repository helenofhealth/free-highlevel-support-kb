**Ejecting a Sub-Account** feature allows you to seamlessly convert a sub-account within your agency into a separate, independent agency account. This feature is ideal when you want to push one of your existing sub-accounts to operate as its own standalone agency.

  
As part of the process, you'll nominate one user from the sub-account to become the new agency owner. The nominated user will then receive an invitation via email to sign up for the **$97/month plan**. Upon their successful signup, you will be rewarded with **40% affiliate commission** on all of their future renewals.

**Note:** They will all be set to Draft.

# Phone Number Transfers

**Both Agencies are on LeadConnector**

* If BOTH the releasing and receiving agencies along with the sub-account that needs to be transferred is on LC, then the phone numbers will automatically be transferred with the sub-account.
* A2P DLC status will be retained. Sub-accounts do not need to again register the phone numbers that are already registered.
* All the phone usage charges going forward will be accrued by the receiving agency.

  
**Both Agencies are not on LeadConnector (Either one or Both are Twilio)**

No phone numbers will be transferred over by HighLevel. It is your responsibility to work with the previous account owner as well as Twilio to move over any or all phone numbers that you may want to keep connected to the transferred sub-account.

  
Kindly reach out to [HighLevel Support](https://app.gohighlevel.com/support) for any concerns.

## **Domain Transfers**

  
Here’s how domains (including subdomains) are handled when you eject a sub-account to a new agency, based on the article and HighLevel’s domain setup flow:

1. **Domains are _not_ automatically carried over.**  
In the “What is the setup that new agency will need once the transfer is made?” section of the Eject Sub-Account article, HighLevel explicitly notes:  
> You will have to re-add your domains” help.gohighlevel.com  
> This means any custom URLs—whether a root domain (e.g. mybusiness.com) or a subdomain (e.g. marketing.mybusiness.com)—must be reconfigured in the newly created agency. None of the old DNS records “move” automatically.
2. **“Domain” here includes both root domains and subdomains.**  
In HighLevel, when you “connect a domain,” you can choose to enter either a root domain or a subdomain. The process for each is very similar:
* For a **root domain** (e.g. `mydomain.com`), you enter it exactly as-is into the Domain field, then update your DNS provider with the accompanying records (often an A record or a CNAME for `www` that points to HighLevel).
* For a **subdomain** (e.g. `funnels.mydomain.com` or `pages.mydomain.com`), you enter that full subdomain string into the Domain field. HighLevel then generates DNS records—almost always a CNAME—that you copy over to your DNS host.  
    
In both cases, once your DNS propagates, HighLevel will validate and issue an SSL certificate automatically.

  
Because domains (and subdomains) are not “inherited” during the eject process, plan on reconfiguring them immediately after the sub-account is accepted by its new owner. This ensures that any existing funnels, websites, or branded links continue to resolve without downtime.

# Sub-Account Transfer FAQs

1\. What is the prep that I have to do to the sub-account before ejecting?

* Set all users that you want to be transferred over are User Type ‘Account’ and only assigned to this specific sub-account being transferred.
* Any SaaS sub-account will need to have SaaS disabled.
* All active subscriptions like Wordpress, Yext, Whatsapp, Dedicated IP etc. will have to be cancelled before the transfer is requested.

2\. What is the setup that new agency will need once the transfer is made?

* You will need to reconnect all auth connections (ex: Google, FB, Quickbooks, Clio, DrChrono)
* You will have to reintegrate Facebook and Google
* You will have setup the sub-account-level Stripe
* You will have to re-add LC Email, Mailgun/SMTP, and Twilio
* You will have to re-add your domains
* Any SaaS sub-accounts will have to have SaaS re-enabled.

  
3\. Can I eject a HIPAA-enabled Sub-account?  
Yes, you can eject a HIPAA-enabled sub-account. However, the new agency will be required to purchase the HIPAAAdd-on during the signup process. This add-on will automatically be included in the order summary at checkout, ensuring the new agency maintains HIPAA compliance.  
  
4\. Will the deleted workflows be visible in the "Deleted" tab when a location is transferred?

Deleted workflows from the old location will not be visible in the new location. Only the deleted workflows from the new location will be displayed in the "Deleted" tab.

  
5\. What about whitelabel (app) subdomains?  
If your agency has a whitelabel domain—commonly something like `app.yourbrand.com`—that also does _not_ transfer automatically.
