## **What are Custom Values?**

  
Custom values are user-defined data placeholders that store and manage specific information within a system or application. They allow users to organize and retrieve personalized or standardized data efficiently. These values are often used in various contexts, such as customer relationship management (CRM) systems, content management systems (CMS), marketing automation platforms, and more.

  
In the context of HighLevel, these custom values store personalized information such as contact details, preferences, or specific identifiers. By leveraging custom values, businesses can efficiently populate and personalize messages, emails, and website or funnel pages to enhance customer interactions and improve engagement.

## **Key Features of Custom Values**

  
* **Personalization:** Custom values enable the storage of individualized information for each entity, such as customers, users, or leads. This information can range from names, contact details, and preferences to unique identifiers like account numbers or booking references.
* **Efficiency:** By storing data in custom values, users can easily access and manipulate this information across different parts of a system. This eliminates the need to repeatedly enter the same information in multiple places, reducing manual effort and the likelihood of errors.
* **Automation:** Custom values often support automation. They can auto-populate fields, generate personalized emails, customize messages, and streamline workflows. For instance, in email marketing, a custom value for a recipient's first name can be inserted to address them personally.
* **Consistency:** Custom values can be used to ensure consistency for data that remains constant for a group of entities. This is valuable for details like company addresses, support contact information, and branding elements.
* **Flexibility:** Users can define custom values based on their specific needs. This flexibility makes custom values adaptable to various scenarios, industries, and organizational structures.
* **Updates:** Modifying a custom value's data doesn't require changes in every instance where it's used. Altering the value at its source automatically updates it wherever it's employed.
* **Data Integrity:** Custom values help maintain data integrity. For instance, using a custom value for an appointment time ensures consistency and reduces the risk of discrepancies.
* **Segmentation and Filtering:** In systems that support segmentation, custom values can be used as criteria for dividing and categorizing data sets. This aids in targeted communications and reporting.
* **Centralized Management:** Custom values often have a central management interface. Users can add, modify, or delete custom values as needed, providing a streamlined way to oversee information organization.
* **Integration:** Many systems allow integration with external sources like databases or APIs. Custom values can be linked to these sources, enriching the system's data capabilities.

  
Using custom values empowers users to make the most of their data by enhancing personalization, automating processes, ensuring accuracy, and enabling more effective decision-making. They play a significant role in optimizing data-driven workflows and providing tailored experiences for users and customers alike.

## **Real-Life Examples/Use Cases**

  
### **Example #1:**

  
Imagine you're managing a digital marketing campaign for a fitness club. Each member of the club has different fitness goals, preferred workout types, and communication preferences. By using custom values in HighLevel, you can store this personalized information and use it to tailor your marketing efforts. These custom values might include data points like the member's name, preferred workout type, membership level, and last visit date.

  
**By using HighLevel custom values, you can:**

  
* **Personalize Emails:** Automatically populate email templates with each member’s name, preferred workout type, and other relevant details.
* **Customize Messages:** Use custom values to create targeted messages that address each member’s specific needs and preferences.
* **Enhance Web Pages:** Dynamically display personalized content on your website or funnel pages based on the stored custom values.

  
### **Example #2:**

  
If you were to run a re-engagement campaign for your fitness club members, you could use custom values to make your communications more relevant and appealing. Let’s break this down:

  
**1\. Collecting Data:**

* **Member A:** Name: John, Preferred Workout: Yoga, Membership Level: Gold, Last Visit: June 1, 2024.
* **Member B:** Name: Sarah, Preferred Workout: Cardio, Membership Level: Silver, Last Visit: May 25, 2024.

  
**2\. Storing Data:**

* In HighLevel, you create custom value fields for any and all types of data including name, preferred workout, membership level, and last visit date.
* Each member’s profile stores their specific information in these fields.

  
**3\. Utilizing Data:**

* **Personalized Emails:** Send an email to John that starts with “Hi John,” and includes content about upcoming yoga classes and exclusive Gold member perks.
* **Targeted Messages:** Send a text message to Sarah saying, “Hey Sarah, we miss you! Join us for a high-energy cardio session this week.”
* **Customized Web Pages:** When John logs into his member portal, he sees a welcome message like “Welcome back, John! Ready for your next yoga session?”

  
**4\. Enhancing Customer Experience:**

* By using custom values, your communications feel more personal and relevant to each member, increasing the likelihood of engagement and re-engagement.

  
By incorporating HighLevel custom values, you can transform generic communications into personalized interactions. This not only enhances the customer experience but also drives higher engagement and loyalty.

  
So, if you were to launch a new promotional campaign, you can use custom values to populate data into your messages, emails, and web pages, ensuring that each touchpoint is tailored to the recipient’s unique preferences and needs. This approach helps you connect more effectively with your audience and achieve better results from your marketing efforts.
