# **What are Custom Fields?**

  
Custom fields let you store additional information about contacts or opportunities beyond the default fields (like name, phone, email). You can use them in forms, surveys, automation workflows, and pipelines to collect and reference key data specific to your business.

---

## **Key Benefits of Custom Fields**

  
Custom fields give you flexibility in data collection, segmentation, and automation:

  
* **Collect custom data**: Capture business-specific info like lead type, budget range, or preferred contact method.
* **Use across tools**: Deploy custom fields in forms, surveys, workflows, and pipelines for full coverage.
* **Personalize automations**: Merge field values into texts, emails, or internal notifications for tailored messaging.
* **Segment contacts easily**: Create Smart Lists or filter workflows based on custom field data.
* **Stay organized**: Group related fields under folders to keep contact and opportunity records tidy.
* **Display critical info**: Show key custom field values directly on opportunity cards or in notifications.

## **Contact vs. Opportunity Custom Fields**

  
Choosing the right type of custom field is essential for keeping your data organized and functional. In HighLevel, you can create two types of custom fields: Contact custom fields and Opportunity custom fields. While they may seem similar, they serve different purposes and are used in different parts of the platform.

  
**Contact custom fields** are attached to the individual person. Use them to store personal details like lead type (e.g., buyer or seller), birthday, preferred contact method, or referral source. These fields appear in the contact record and can be used in forms, surveys, contact workflows, Smart Lists, and message personalization using merge fields.  
  
**Opportunity custom fields** are linked to a specific deal or sales opportunity. Use them to capture deal-specific information such as budget range, urgency, timeline to close, or property type. These fields appear only within the opportunity record and are used in pipeline views, opportunity workflows, and deal-level reporting or automation.

  
**Note:** Once a field is created as either a contact or opportunity field, it cannot be switched.

## **Organizing Custom Fields with Folders**

  
Organizing your fields keeps your data tidy and easier to use inside contacts and opportunities.  
  
* **Folders** (also called groups) appear as sections in your contact/opportunity records.
* You can move fields between folders using **bulk actions**.
* Create groups in **Settings > Custom Fields > + Add Folder**.

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

  
**Q: Can I convert a contact field into an opportunity field (or vice versa)?**  
No. You must recreate the field under the correct object type. Field objects cannot be changed after creation.

  
**Q: What types of fields can I create?**  
You can create Short Text, Long Text, Drop downs, Date Pickers, Phone, Email, Radio Selects, Checkbox Groups, URLs, and more.

  
**Q: Why don’t my fields show in a form or workflow?**  
Ensure the object type matches the use case. Only Contact fields appear in forms and contact workflows.

  
**Q: How many options can the Dropdown (multiple) custom field have?**

The Dropdown (multiple) field can have a lot of options (50+) so there is no practical limit.
