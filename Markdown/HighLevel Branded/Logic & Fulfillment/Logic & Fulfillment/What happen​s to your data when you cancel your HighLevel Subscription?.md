1. **Contacts:** All saved contact data will no longer be accessible.
2. **Conversations:** Ongoing and past conversations will no longer be accessible.
3. **Calendars:** Any Scheduled Events and Appointments will no longer be accessible.
4. **Automations:** Any workflows and automations will stop functioning.
5. **Funnels:** All funnels and related data will no longer be accesible.
6. **Phone Numbers and A2P:** Your Phone numbers and A2P will be deleted 14 days after cancellation. During this time, you will still be charged for the same. After 14 days , these numbers will be permanently deleted.

  
When you cancel your HighLevel subscription, your agency data is retained for **90 days**. This allows you to reactivate your account and recover your data if you decide to return. After 90 days, your data is **automatically and permanently deleted** on the 91st day. If you prefer to have your data deleted sooner, you can submit a request using the [Data Deletion Request Form](https://www.gohighlevel.com/privacy-and-security)
