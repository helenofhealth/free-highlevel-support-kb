As an agency owner, you're seeing the **full suite of migration options** inside the WordPress Hosting dashboard. This includes access to our premium **White-Glove Migration Assistance** — a service exclusively available to agencies.

###   

### What You See (Agency View)

You’ll see all three migration options:

1. **Effortless Migration with our Plugin**  
One-click, fast migration via the LeadConnector Plugin.
2. **Manual Migration Made Simple**  
Use the All-in-One Migration plugin to upload your `.wpress` file.
3. **White-Glove Migration Assistance** _(Agency-only)_  
Submit a form to have our WordPress specialists handle the migration for you.

✅ These options are visible **only to you**, not to your clients or their sub-accounts.

### What Your Sub-Accounts See

Your sub-accounts will **only see the two standard migration options**:

1. **Effortless Migration with our Plugin**
2. **Manual Migration Made Simple**

They **will not see** the White-Glove Migration Assistance option.  
They also do not see any labels or indicators revealing that there are features they are missing.

This ensures your **white-label experience remains intact**, and your clients won't know about the behind-the-scenes support available to you as an agency.

### Why the Difference?

The **White-Glove Migration** feature is a premium benefit tailored for agency-level control and flexibility. Allowing only agency owners to access it prevents confusion for sub-accounts and protects your brand's white-label offering.

###   

### Need to Guide a Sub-Account?

If you’re guiding a client through migration:

* You can recommend the **plugin-based migration** for simplicity.
* Or handle the entire migration yourself using the **White-Glove option** on their behalf.
