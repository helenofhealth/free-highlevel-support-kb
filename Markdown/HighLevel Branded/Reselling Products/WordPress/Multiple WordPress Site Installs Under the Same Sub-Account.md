### **2\. Enhanced Billing & Subscription Tracking:**

* Accurate Billing: Our billing and subscription systems have been upgraded to track and manage charges for each website under a subaccount individually. This ensures a smooth and transparent billing process, so you can focus on what matters—growing your agency.
* Clear Upsell Opportunities: Agency owners can now easily see how many sites within a location are hosted with or without upselling, helping you to maximize your revenue potential.
