Understand the core components that make this feature powerful and easy to use.
  
  
### **Centralized Suggestion Hub**

  
This hub consolidates all external listing suggestions into one organized interface, allowing you to review them efficiently. No more switching between platforms to manage updates.
  
  
### **Seamless Data Syncing**

  
Once a suggestion is accepted, it’s instantly updated in your Listings and distributed across all connected publisher networks. This ensures that your customers always see the most up-to-date business information, regardless of where they find you online.

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

  
**Q: What types of updates can be suggested?**

Publishers may submit changes such as business name updates, new hours, address modifications, phone number corrections, and more.

  
**Q: What happens after I accept a suggestion?**

The update is immediately applied to your Listings and synced with all connected directories like Google, Facebook, and Yelp.

  
**Q: Can I undo a rejected suggestion?**

Rejected suggestions are removed from the list, but if a publisher re-submits the same suggestion later, you’ll be able to review it again.

  
**Q: Are publisher suggestions always accurate?**

Not necessarily. Publisher data may be outdated or incorrect. Reviewing each suggestion manually ensures only relevant and verified data is published.

  
**Q: Can I disable publisher suggestions?**

Suggestions cannot be disabled, but they are never auto-applied—your team retains full control and must manually approve each one.

  
**Q: How often are suggestions updated or refreshed?**

The system checks regularly for new submissions from publishers and will display them in the Suggestions Hub as they come in.
