## **Understanding Listings Billing**

  
Listings reselling uses a two-layer billing structure:  
  
* **Agency → HighLevel:** You are charged monthly via your agency wallet
* **Client → Agency:** Clients are charged via your Stripe integration

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155049319941/original/CSlJPRbXcZ1QiuxFZgs_-nAGSB7FkRZisg.png?1751577642)

---

## **Understanding the HighLevel Invoice**

  
As your agency makes sales on different days during your billing period, your charges will get pro-rated on the next billing cycle.

  
We do pro-rated billing to ensure you receive a single invoice in the same billing period, even though the sales are made on different days within the month. 

  
Each invoice adjusts for the sales made in the previous billing cycle + prepay for the next billing cycle.

  
**Example Invoice:**

  
**![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155049319946/original/4RmDKy2J5JocL_tjwhAk1hjgeDcpPwl-gg.png?1751577685)**

## **Troubleshooting**

  
In some rare cases, the Online Listings might not work as expected. A few possible scenarios are covered below:
  
  
### **My listings look wrong / my listings are waiting on customer / my listings are waiting on partner / all my listings are still processing**

####   

In all such cases, the common reason is that you have a mistake in the form data that you or your client had submitted. The error could be in:  
  
* Address Field  
    
   * PIN Code is written in the address line field  
   * PO Box used instead of a real address  
   * Only Street Address used (Suite number, shop number missing)
* Business Name is improper
* The phone number is not valid
* email ID is not a valid email

As agency users, you can easily fix this issue by logging into the Listings account and fixing any errors.

This happens when Listings has found a duplicate listing for the same address, phone number, or email ID.
