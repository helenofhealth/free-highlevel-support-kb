# **Overview: Deploying Listings Without Client Billing**

  
Deploying Listings without charging the client directly enables agencies to provide added value through a seamless, behind-the-scenes service. This method is especially useful when Listings is included in a packaged offering, used for internal brand management, or offered as part of a premium experience without exposing the individual cost. It allows the agency to retain full control over the setup, pricing strategy, and service continuity.
