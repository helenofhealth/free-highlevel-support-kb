To swiftly resolve this matter, we kindly request your attention to the following steps:

1. Begin by logging into the Sub Account/Location portal.
2. Navigate to the Reputation section and proceed to the Listings page.
3. Here, you'll find a highlighted link that will direct you to an email pre-addressed with the Yext GHL in CC. Kindly include pertinent details such as business name, address, and phone number in the email body for the Yext support team to investigate the issue thoroughly.

  
Please note that if necessary, we may require confirmation from Yext regarding the resubmission of the Yext request for the sub-account. This precautionary step is essential due to the potential complexities involved when canceling Yext services through a third-party provider.
  
  
Should you require any further assistance or clarification, please do not hesitate to reach out to us.
