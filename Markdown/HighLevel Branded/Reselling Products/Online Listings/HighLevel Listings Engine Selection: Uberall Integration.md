* The engine selection **only affects newly created entities** after the selection
* If you with to switch an existing entity to the other engine, you'll need to:  
    
   1. **Unsubscribe** it from the current engine  
   2. **Re-subscribe** it once the agency-level engine is switched

---

## **Getting Started**

  
#### **Engine Selection (Agency-Level Configuration)**

  
When you first access the Listings product, you will see a modal allowing you to choose between **Uberall** and **Yext** as your preferred Listings Management Engine

  
**Important:** The selected engine will apply to all your agency's sub-accounts and the business entities they manage. You cannot run listings through both engines in parallel for the same agency.
  
  
#### **Checkbox Confirmation**

  
After selecting an engine, you'll need to confirm via checkbox:

_"I understand that this engine will be the default for all new entities my subaccounts create, and agree to move forward with this selection"_

## **How to Select Your Listings Engine (Agency-Level Setup)**

  
Please note that engine selection is available only at the agency level, and all new sub-accounts and business entities under the agency will automatically inherit this engine.

  
Here’s how to configure your preferred Listings engine:
  
  
#### **Step 1:** Navigate to Reselling

  
* Log in to your agency dashboard in the HighLevel app
* From the left navigation menu, click on the **Reselling** tab

#### **Step 2:** Open Selection Modal

  
* Scroll down to locate the **Listings** card
* Click on **C** **hange Engine** to open the selection modal

#### **Step 3:** Choose Preferred Engine

  
* You’ll see a side-by-side comparison of **Uberall** and **Yext**, including key benefits and differentiators for each
* Choose your preferred engine
* After selecting an engine, confirm using the checkbox after reading the warning

  
**Important**: Sub-accounts will always experience a **white labeled** **version of the Listings product**, so they won’t see the underlying engine name — just a seamless Listings interface powered by your agency’s chosen engine.

####   

####   
**Step 4:** Confirm Listings Engine

  
* Once confirmed, the selected engine will begin to reflect on the Listings card as **Powered by Uberall** or **Powered by Yext**

## **Changing the Engine Later**

  
While the engine is initially locked in post-selection, **you may request a change via the same engine selector modal for new entities.** Please note:  
  
* All existing entities will still be active on the current engine. This is because switching to a new engine would essentially mean cancelling subscription from one engine and then activating it in the other engine - which may cause publisher data sync delays.,
* The new engine will then become the active one for all future subscriptions.

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

  
**Q: Can I use Uberall for some sub‑accounts and Yext for others?**  
No, you cannot run listings through both engines in parallel for the same agency. You can switch later, but the change is made at the agency level, not the sub-account level.

  
**Q: What happens to my current listings when I switch engines?**  
Those will continue to work as‑is with the current engine (Yext or Uberall). The engine selection only affects newly created entities after the selection.

  
**Q: Will my clients see Uberall or Yext branding?**  
Sub-accounts will always experience a white labeled version of the Listings product, so they won’t see the underlying engine name.
