**Please note:**

Branded Client Portal Mobile App under app settings won’t be visible for the location until this manual deployment takes place(in case agency does not have a Stripe account). It’s important to highlight that manual deployment won’t establish a subscription between the location and agency, while subscriptions with GHL and the agency will still be created.
