# Introducing the "Valid WhatsApp" Field at the Contact Level

We have introduced a new field called "Valid WhatsApp" at the contact level to help businesses identify the WhatsApp status of their contacts more efficiently. This feature provides clear insights into whether a contact's phone number is active on WhatsApp, making communication smoother and more targeted.

---

# Understanding the "Valid WhatsApp" Field

The "Valid WhatsApp" field helps determine the WhatsApp availability of a contact's phone number. It includes three possible statuses:

1\. Is Valid – The phone number is active on WhatsApp, meaning you can send messages to this contact successfully.

2\. Is Invalid – The phone number is not available on WhatsApp, meaning the contact cannot receive WhatsApp messages.

3.Is Not Validated – The system has not yet confirmed whether the phone number is active on WhatsApp. This may require further validation before messaging the contact.

---

# How to Use This Feature

With the "Valid WhatsApp" filter, businesses can:  
✔ Ensure they are messaging only active WhatsApp users.  
✔ Avoid sending messages to inactive or non-WhatsApp numbers, reducing failed delivery attempts.  
✔ Identify numbers that need further validation before sending messages.

This feature helps improve efficiency, message deliverability, and overall engagement with contacts.

# How is the Valid WhatsApp field updated

  
### **1\. When a Message is Successfully Delivered on WhatsApp**

When a message is successfully delivered, the system automatically marks the contact as "**Is Valid"**

  
### **2\. If a Message Fails to Deliver or Encounters Meta Issues:**

In cases where a message fails to deliver or encounters issues with Meta, the contact is marked as "Is InValid"

  
### **3\. When a Contact Initiates a WhatsApp Message:**

When a contact initiates a WhatsApp message, the status is updated to "Is Valid," ensuring real-time validation. This reflects that the contact has actively engaged via WhatsApp, confirming the validity of their number.

  
### **4\. If There is No Conversation Over WhatsApp:**

If there is no conversation over WhatsApp with a particular contact, the status remains in the "Not Validated" state until further interaction.
