## **What is WhatsApp Template Folders?**

  
WhatsApp Template Folders is a new organizational tool within HighLevel that allows users to create custom folders and subfolders for WhatsApp templates. Instead of a single, flat list, you can now categorize templates by use case, campaign, or any structure that fits your workflow. This helps teams quickly locate, manage, and update templates, especially as your template library grows.
