## **How Contacts and Conversation will be synced**

  
The synchronization process for your chats and contacts typically takes between 4 to 6 hours to complete. The exact duration depends on the volume of data being transferred, specifically:

  
* The number of chat conversations in your history
* The total number of contacts in your WhatsApp Business account

  
**Once the synchronization is complete:**  

* Your chat conversations will be accessible under the **Conversations** tab in your sub-account.
* Your contacts will be listed under the **Contacts** tab.

Please note that the synchronization time may vary slightly based on network conditions and the current load on our servers. During this period, it's important to keep your WhatsApp Business App open and ensure your device maintains a stable internet connection to facilitate a smooth data transfer.  
  
**During the synchronisation process, please ensure:**  

* Your WhatsAppBusiness **App remains open and active** on your device.
* Your device maintains a **stable internet connection** throughout the process.
* These steps are crucial for a successful and uninterrupted data transfer

##   **Advanced CRM Capabilities**

  
* **Bulk WhatsApp Messaging:** schedule promotions, updates, campaigns; track delivery & engagement.
* **Automations / Workflows:** trigger WhatsApp templates when leads submit forms, miss calls, abandon carts, etc.
* **Interactive Templates:** buttons, quick replies, catalogs; sent only from CRM.
* **Voice Notes:** record/send directly in CRM.
* **In‑App Appointment Booking:** embed scheduling links in WhatsApp messages.

1. **Messages sent from WhatsApp Business App:**  
   * These messages will remain free, just as they are today.

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

  
**Q: What version of the WhatsApp Business App do I need?**

You need to have the latest version of WhatsApp Business App, version 2.24.17 or newer.

  
**Q: Who is the Coexistence Feature designed for?**

It's designed for WhatsApp businesses who primarily use the WhatsApp Business App and are looking for advanced tools to manage conversations at scale or integrate complex needs such as payments, shipping, and leads management.

  
**Q. Is there a limit on the number of marketing messages a Coexistence business can send on Cloud API?**

The limit would follow the existing Messaging Limits. In addition, please note that you are not required to complete Business Verification in order to unlock a higher messaging limit than 250 business-initiated conversations in a 24-hour moving period. Open 1,000 or more business-initiated conversations in a 30-day moving period using templates with a high quality rating rating. Once you reach this threshold, we will analyze your messaging quality to determine if your messaging activity warrants an increase to your messaging limit. Based on this analysis, we will then either approve or deny an increase. Businesses can increase their messaging limit from 250 to 1,000 and show their business’ display name.

  
**Q. If I already have the Meta Verified blue badge in WhatsApp Business App, will I be able to maintain that when I connect to a partner platform?**

At the moment, WhatsApp Coexistence feature doesn’t allow blue badge verification transfers from the SMB app to the Cloud API or vice versa.

  
**Q. Why is my country not supported for WhatsApp Business accounts?**

WhatsApp has restrictions on certain country codes due to regulatory, compliance, or service limitations. Unfortunately, if your country is on the unsupported list, you won’t be able to register a WhatsApp Business account using a phone number with that country code.

  
**Q. Do I need admin access to enable the Coexistence Feature?**

Yes, in most cases, only users with admin privileges can access and modify this setting.

  
**Q.Will enabling the Coexistence Feature affect existing configurations?**

No, enabling this feature will not overwrite or disrupt existing settings. It simply allows multiple functionalities to coexist smoothly.

  
**Q.Is it possible to retain the same phone number during the migration from the WhatsApp Business App to the Business Platform?**

Yes, businesses can retain their existing phone numbers during the migration process, ensuring continuity in customer communications.

  
**Q: What if I already have the Meta‑Verified blue badge?** 
Badge status cannot be transferred between the mobile app and Cloud API at this time.

  
**Q: How do I disconnect later?** 
On your phone, go to Settings → Business Tools → WhatsApp Business Platform → Disconnect LeadConnector.

  
**Q: Will this integration risk my WhatsApp account being banned?** 
No. The connection uses Meta‑approved Cloud API methods and is 100 % policy‑compliant.

  
**Q. Can we add multiple numbers with Coexistence?**

No only one number supported with Coexistence
