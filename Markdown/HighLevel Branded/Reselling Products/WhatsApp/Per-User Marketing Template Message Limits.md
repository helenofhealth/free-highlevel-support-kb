## Per-User Marketing Template Message Limits

### What is it?

WhatsApp may limit the number of marketing template messages a person receives from any business in a given period of time, starting with a small number of conversations that are less likely to be read. Soon, we will also start to deliver fewer marketing conversations to those users who are less likely to engage with them.

### Why itâ€™s important

WhatsApp has found that per-user marketing template limits maximize message engagement and improve the user experience, measured through improvements in user read rates and sentiment. This limit helps WhatsApp users find business messaging more valuable and feel less like they receive too many business messages.

### How this Applies to Your Business

The limit only applies to marketing template messages that would normally open a new [marketing conversation](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/pricing). If a marketing conversation is already open between you and a WhatsApp user, you may send one additional marketing template message. Further marketing template messages can only be sent in an open marketing conversation if the person responds to any message.

**Example:**

* The first marketing template message is delivered and opens a new [24-hour marketing conversation](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/cloud-api/guides/send-messages#customer-service-windows) customer service window. The per-user marketing template message limit applies
* A second marketing template message can be sent in an existing conversation.
* Each time the WhatsApp user responds in an existing conversation window, you can send one additional marketing template message. You can also send unlimited [free-form](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/cloud-api/guides/send-messages) messages.
