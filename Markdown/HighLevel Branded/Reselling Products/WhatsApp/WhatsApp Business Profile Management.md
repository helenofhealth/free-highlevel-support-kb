The WhatsApp Business API client scales and crops uploaded profile photos to be a square with a max edge of 640px and max size of 5MB before uploading to our servers. 

Images with a height or width of less than 192px may cause issues when the resizing occurs, because of this, **an image size of 640x640 is recommended.**
  
  
## **How Customers View Your Profile:**

  
Customers can view your business profile by clicking your business's name or number in a conversation thread. This accessibility ensures that your customers always have the latest information about your business at their fingertips.
