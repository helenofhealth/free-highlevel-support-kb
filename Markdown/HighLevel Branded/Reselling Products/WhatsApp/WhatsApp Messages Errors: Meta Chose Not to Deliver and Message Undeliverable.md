## **Meta Chose Not to Deliver**

### **What it Means**

This error indicates that the message was not delivered by Meta to maintain a healthy ecosystem of engagement. It primarily applies to marketing template messages that are subject to **Per-User Marketing Template Message Limits**.

### **Why it Occurs**

* WhatsApp may limit the number of marketing template messages delivered to users who are less likely to engage.
* This measure improves user experience by maximizing message engagement and minimizing unwanted messages.

### **How to Resolve**

1. **Do Not Retry Immediately:**  
   * If you receive this error, avoid retrying immediately. Instead, retry in gradually increasing time increments until the message is delivered.  
   * This ensures compliance with Meta’s limits and prevents further disruptions.
2. **Understand Per-User Marketing Template Message Limits:**  
   * Marketing messages are restricted based on user engagement patterns.  
   * If a marketing conversation is open, one additional marketing message can be sent without triggering the limit.  
   * Unlimited free-form messages can be sent once the user responds.

### **Best Practices**

* Ensure marketing messages are timely, relevant, and expected to improve user engagement.
* Use personalized messages that add value, such as information related to recent purchases or exclusive offers.
* Monitor message delivery and engagement to adjust your messaging strategy proactively.

### **Why It’s Important**

* Following these limits improves user sentiment, read rates, and the overall experience for WhatsApp users.
* High-quality engagements make your business eligible for more features on the WhatsApp Business Platform.
