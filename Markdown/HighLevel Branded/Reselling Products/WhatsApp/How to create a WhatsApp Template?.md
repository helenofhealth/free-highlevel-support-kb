**Template Category Validation in WhatsApp Manager**

  
When you create a new template in **WhatsApp Manager**, you must select a **category** for it (e.g., Marketing, Utility, or Authentication).

  
Meta will then validate your chosen category against its official **template category guidelines**. Based on the validation outcome, the system will assign a status to your template—such as **Approved**, **Pending**, or **Rejected**.

  
It’s important to ensure your message content matches the selected category to avoid delays or rejections during the approval process
