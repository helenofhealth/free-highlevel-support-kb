## **Pre-requisites for Auto-Reselling**

### **Connect Your Agency Stripe Account**

To resell WhatsApp, you need to connect your **agency's Stripe account**, which will be used to collect subscription payments from your clients.

? Follow this guide to connect Stripe: [How to Connect Stripe to Your Agency Dashboard](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/48001171910-how-to-connect-stripe-to-your-agency-dashboard)

? **Don’t have Stripe?** You can still **deploy WhatsApp** without using the auto-reselling feature. However, in this case, your agency will be directly billed instead of charging the client.

Let me know if you'd like further refinements! ?

## **How do I disable WhatsApp for certain clients?**

If you have certain clients that you do not wish to offer WhatsApp to, you can do so by following these two steps:

  
**Step 1:** Go to Sub-Account List -> search for Client -> Click on three dots -> Manage Clients

  
![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155008617196/original/ESt8rJrKH8t72uVukevwtQGG4hbxPT2rtg.png?1695731785)

  
**Step 2:** Scroll down to the reselling section -> Disable WhatsApp by toggle -> Hit Save

  
![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155008615187/original/oHFFi5n-bo-zkZCOVpywKe_iXQJcwMPGPQ.png?1695730702)

**Please note:**

This offer can only be disabled before the sale has happened. Once a location already purchases WhatsApp, you can not disable it from here. 
Disabling WhatsApp after the subscription is initiated would mean cancellation. For cancelling the subscription please create a support ticket.

**Please note:**

WhatsApp tab won’t be visible for the location until this manual deployment takes place(in case agency does not have a Stripe account). It’s important to highlight that manual deployment won’t establish a subscription between the location and agency, while subscriptions with GHL and the agency will still be created.

  
**Conversation Charges**

  
In case agency choses Deploy WhatsApp Directly, then the [WhatsApp conversation charges](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/155000001428-whatsapp-pricing-and-billing-full-guide#Conversation-Based-Pricing) will be deducted from the agency's wallet and location will not be charged for the WhatsApp conversations.

## **How do your Clients complete the purchase?**

Once clients discover the WhatsApp feature, they can easily purchase it by entering their payment details and clicking the **Confirm** button. Upon confirmation, our system automatically processes the payment and sets up the required subscriptions.

  
 **Important Note:** Two separate subscriptions will be created:
  
  
Step 1: **Between GoHighLevel and the Agency**  
Step 2: **Between the Agency and the Sub-Account**

  
After completing the purchase, clients will be redirected to the WhatsApp signup page, where they can seamlessly integrate their WhatsApp account.

## **How does the billing work?**

When your client purchases WhatsApp it creates 2 subscriptions in the System

1. Between your client's card & your Stripe Account so you can collect payment from your clients
2. Between HighLevel & your Stripe account, you pay $10/month/location to HighLevel  
![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155010213562/original/dN_oYi_aEBetlYHpguinC7YEVse4KZihaA.png?1697462471)
3. The monthly charge gets you free inbound and outbound messages. When the lead sends an inbound text it gives you a 24-hour window when you can text them back. The window keeps extending with every message.
4. If you need to do outreach or if it's been more than 24 hours you will need to use a campaign/template message which is charged. That opens the conversation up for 24 hour window which again keeps extending with every message
5. All the outbound template messages will be charged to the location and agency based on the Country the message is sent to and the type of Template \[Marketing, Utility, Authentication and Services\] used. Attached is the list for reference.
