# What is WhatsAppV2 Action?

WhatsAppV2 Action is the next-gen automation tool for sending and managing WhatsApp messages inside workflows. Unlike the older WhatsAppV1, this new version adds smart branching, timeout-based responses, media control, and reply-driven logic—enabling users to create dynamic, high-conversion chat flows with ease.

## How To Use WhatsAppV2 in a Workflow

Build intelligent WhatsApp journeys with just a few clicks.

1. Create a WhatsApp Template  
    
   * Use the Messaging > Templates area to build or select a template.  
   * Add buttons, media, or Meta Flows based on your goal.
2. Add WhatsAppV2 to Your Workflow  
    
   * From the workflow builder, add the WhatsAppV2 Action.  
   * Choose your message type: template, free-form, or flow-enabled.
3. Configure Smart Logic  
    
   * Select reply buttons (if any) to auto-generate branches.  
   * Add timeout duration and fallback paths.  
   * Enable or disable wait-for-reply options.
4. Monitor Logs

## Smart Branching Based on Button Replies

Let the system do the heavy lifting.

When your WhatsApp template includes reply buttons, WhatsAppV2 automatically creates workflow branches for each response. No need to manually build conditions or filters.

## Timeout & Wait-For-Reply Logic

React to silence or replies with precision.

* Timeout: Trigger a follow-up or fallback action after a set period of no response.
* Wait-for-Reply: Pause the workflow entirely until the user responds (useful for high-engagement flows).

## Editing Media on the Fly

Change your media links without rebuilding templates.

WhatsAppV2 allows you to modify the URLs for images, PDFs, and videos inside the message configuration—even if they’re part of an approved template. This makes it easier to reuse and customize templates without extra approval steps.
