* Templates with mixed content (e.g. Both utility and marketing, such as order update with a promo or offer).
* Templates where contents are unclear (e.g., contents are only “{{1}}” or “Congratulations!”).

Utility templates are typically triggered by a user action or request. They must include specificity about the active or ongoing transaction, account, subscription or interaction to which they relate. For example, an order confirmation must contain an order number.

## **\[To be Released\] Authentication templates**

Authentication templates enable businesses to authenticate users with one-time passcodes (usually 4-8 digit alphanumeric codes), potentially at multiple steps in the login process (e.g., account verification, account recovery, integrity challenges).

Authentication templates are our most restricted. For a template to be classified as authentication, a business must:

1. Use WhatsApp’s preset authentication message templates, which include optional add-ons like security disclaimers and expiry warnings
2. Configure a one-time password button (copy-code or one-tap)
3. Follow content restrictions: URLs, media, and emojis are not allowed for authentication template content or parameters. Additional length restrictions of 15 characters also apply to parameters.

  
| Definition          | Examples                                                                                                                                                                           |

## **FAQs**

## How can we assign a category to a template?

When you create a message template, you select the category you believe applies, based on the template category guidelines outlined above. We then determine the template’s category, based on the template contents and these same guidelines. If we agree with the category you designated, we set the template status to PENDING (it then goes through template review to ensure it is in compliance with our policies. If we disagree, we set it to REJECTED.

  
For creating a template please refer to the documentation below:

  
**[How to create a WhatsApp Template?](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/155000000861-how-to-create-a-whatsapp-template-)**

  
## What are WhatsApp message templates?

WhatsApp message templates are pre-approved messages businesses use to communicate with customers outside the 24-hour messaging window. They ensure consistent, structured, and policy-compliant messaging.
  
  
##  How do I assign the correct category to a WhatsApp template?

When creating a template, you must select one of the three categories based on the message’s purpose:

  
Marketing – Promotional messages, offers, and customer engagement.

  
Utility – Order confirmations, payment reminders, and account updates.

  
Authentication – One-time passcodes (OTP) for account verification and login security.

WhatsApp reviews and finalizes the category based on content. If misclassified, the template may be rejected and need revision.
  
  
## What happens if my template is categorized incorrectly?

If WhatsApp determines the category you selected is incorrect, your template will be rejected. You will need to revise and resubmit it under the correct category.
  
  
## What types of messages fall under Marketing Templates?

Marketing templates are the **most flexible** and include:

* Promotional offers and discounts
* Event invitations and announcements
* Retargeting messages (e.g., abandoned cart reminders)
* App promotions and referral programs

  
**Example:**  
_"You left something in your cart! Complete your purchase here: {{1}}."_

  
**Note: Templates with mixed content (e.g., order updates with a promo) are also considered Marketing.**

---

## What qualifies as a Utility Template?

Utility templates provide customer-requested updates and transactional messages such as:

* Order confirmations and tracking updates
* Payment and subscription reminders
* Account alerts and security notifications

 Example:  
_"Your package from order {{1}} is out for delivery. Track it here: {{2}}."_

 Note: Utility templates cannot contain promotions, upsells, or sales-related content.

---

## What are Authentication Templates used for?

Authentication templates are strictly for user verification and must:

* Contain only an OTP (one-time passcode).
* Follow WhatsApp’s preset authentication template format.
* Not include URLs, media, emojis, or promotional content.

Example:  
_"{{1}} is your verification code. Do not share this code."_

---

## Can I mix content from different categories in one template?

No, templates should be clear and specific to one category. A Utility template that includes a promotional message will be categorized as Marketing and may be rejected if misclassified.

---

##  What happens if my template is rejected?

If your template is rejected, it means:

* It may have violated WhatsApp’s policies.
* The content did not match the selected category.

You can edit and resubmit the template after correcting the issue.

---

##  How can I ensure my template gets approved quickly?

✔ Choose the correct category based on the content.  
✔ Ensure the message is clear and contains all necessary details.  
✔ Follow WhatsApp’s guidelines to avoid rejection.

For detailed instructions, refer to \[How to Create a WhatsApp Template?\](Insert Link Here).
