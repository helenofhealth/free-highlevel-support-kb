# **Troubleshooting a Restricted WhatsApp Business Account**

If your WhatsApp Business account is restricted, it means you are temporarily unable to send or respond to messages. This restriction may be applied for security reasons or if WhatsApp detects activity that does not comply with its policies.

  
## **Why Is My WhatsApp Business Account Restricted?**

Your account may have been restricted due to:

* Violation of WhatsApp Business Terms of Service
* Non-compliance with WhatsApp Business Messaging Policy
* Activity that does not follow the WhatsApp Commerce Policy

If you believe your account was restricted by mistake, you can request a review.
