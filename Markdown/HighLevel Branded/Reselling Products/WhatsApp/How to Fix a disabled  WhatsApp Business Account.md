# **How to Fix a Restricted WhatsApp Business Account**

  
If your WhatsApp Business account has been restricted, you won’t be able to send or reply to messages. This usually happens when an account does not follow WhatsApp’s policies.

  
#### Why Was Your Account Restricted?

Your account may be restricted if:

* It violates WhatsApp’s Business Terms of Service.
* It doesn’t follow WhatsApp’s Messaging or Commerce policies.

If you believe your account was restricted by mistake, you can request a review.
