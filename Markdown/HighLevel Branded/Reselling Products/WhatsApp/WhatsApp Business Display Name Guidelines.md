   * Sarah’s Sporting Goods Shop – Guns Department (Restricted product category)
3. **Your Display Name Should Accurately Represent Your Business**  
Your display name must:  
   * Clearly state the business name, product, service, or department.  
   * Be used for test/demo accounts, as long as they are linked to a business (e.g., Fresh Produce Test).
4. Your display name should not:  
   * Be a generic term (e.g., Fashion).  
   * Be a geographic location (e.g., New York).  
   * Include words like Official or Verified, as they imply WhatsApp verification.
