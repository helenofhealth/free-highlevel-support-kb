## 

Once you migrate a phone number to the WhatsApp Business Platform, you cannot use that number on the WhatsApp Business App concurrently. Your number must be used either on the Business Platform or on the Business App.

## **Restrictions for WhatsApp Business Sign-Up**

  
When signing up for the **WhatsApp Business Platform**, businesses must adhere to the following restrictions:

  
1️⃣ **New Phone Number Requirement**

 • Businesses must use a **new** phone number for registration, whether onboarding **manually** or through **Embedded Signup**.

 • **Existing numbers** that are **currently active** on WhatsApp or WhatsApp Business App **cannot** be used for signup.
  
  
## **FAQs**

  
## Q. I received an error message stating that the number is registered to an existing WhatsApp account. What should I do next?

  
![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155043416251/original/x2ne0l3Rhx8UaJ0uQn9n4mOo02IueqAGOA.png?1742215210)

  
**Answer:**

This error usually occurs in two situations:

1. **Active WhatsApp Account on Your Mobile Device:**  
If you currently have an active WhatsApp account on your mobile device, you need to delete that account to connect with the chat account. Follow these steps:  
   * Open the WhatsApp app.  
   * Navigate to Settings > Account > Delete my account.  
   * _Note:_ After integration, you will not be able to use WhatsApp on your phone, and your previous conversation history and contacts will not be migrated

2. **WhatsApp Number Connected to Another Provider:**  
If your WhatsApp number is linked to another provider, you need to create a new WABA account and migrate your number to the new WABA account

  
## Q. You have already linked the maximum number of phone numbers allowed for this business account. Delete a phone number to continue or request additional numbers.

Meta allows you to have only two phone numbers per WABA account
