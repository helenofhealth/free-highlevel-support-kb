**Issue:**  
WhatsApp is in a pending state for a week or more.  
  
  
**Solution:**  
Please advise the client to disconnect the WhatsApp number from any mobile device or other business platforms where it may currently be in use. The number can only be used in one location at a time; it cannot be used across multiple platforms simultaneously.  
  
To check whether the same number is registered on WhatsApp, please refer to the screenshots below.
