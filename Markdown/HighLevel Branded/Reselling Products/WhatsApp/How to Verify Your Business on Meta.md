# **How to Verify Your Business on Meta**

  
**Meta Verified for Business** is a **paid subscription** that helps businesses get better visibility, support, and protection on Meta platforms (like Facebook and Instagram).
  
  
 **Do You Need Business Verification?**

Not every business needs to be verified.

You only need to verify your business if:

 • You’re trying to use certain Meta tools (e.g., APIs, developer features)

 • You received a notification or email asking you to verify
  
  
**Before You Start**

 • Make sure your **business portfolio** (previously called Business Manager) is eligible for verification.

 • You must have **full control** of the business portfolio.

 • **Don’t submit false info**—Meta can deny verification or take action on your account if they find misleading details.
  
  
 **Steps to Verify Your Business**

 1\. **Go to the Security Centre** in your Meta Business portfolio.

 2\. Click **“Start verification.”**_(You might also see this in Meta Ads Manager, Commerce Manager, or App Developer Dashboard)_ 

 3\. **Enter your business details:**

 • Legal business name

 • Address

 • Phone number

 • Website _(must be live and HTTPS-secure)_

 4\. **Confirm the details:**

 • If Meta can match them to public records, select your business from the list.

 • If not, upload documents like a **business license** or **articles of incorporation.**

 5\. **Verify your connection to the business:** Choose one of the following methods:

 • **Email** (must match your domain)

 • **Phone call / Text / WhatsApp message**

 • **Domain verification** (you’ll need access to your website’s hosting or DNS settings)

 6\. Click **Done** once finished.
  
  
 **What Happens Next?**

 • Verification decisions can take **10 minutes to 14 working days**.

 • You’ll be notified once it’s complete.

 • If approved—you’re all set!

 • If you change any business details later, you’ll need to verify again.
