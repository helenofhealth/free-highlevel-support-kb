**Issue:**  
Users are unable to receive the OTP required to verify a WhatsApp number on a sub-account.

**Cause:**  
This issue typically occurs when the WhatsApp number is already registered with the regular WhatsApp Business app.

**Solution:**  
To resolve this issue, follow the steps below:

1. **Verify WhatsApp Registration Status:**  
   * Check if the phone number is already active on WhatsApp.  
   * You can use the online tool at [2Chat WhatsApp Checker](https://2chat.co/tools/whatsapp-checker) to verify if the number is registered.  
   * Alternatively, check directly via the WhatsApp or WhatsApp Business app.
2. **If the Number is Already Registered:**  
   * WhatsAppWhatsapp Number cannot be used for WhatsApp Business API (WABA) while it is registered with the regular WhatsApp Business app.  
         * Use a different phone number to register for WABA, or  
         * Deactivate the existing WhatsApp account associated with the number before attempting registration again.

**Note:** It may take some time for the number to be fully released after deactivation before it can be used for WABA registration.
