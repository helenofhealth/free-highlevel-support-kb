To access certain products and features, Meta may require you to verify your business. This process helps confirm that your Business Manager account belongs to a legitimate and registered business or organization.

  
**Business verification helps:**

* Confirm your business is legally registered and has an official phone number or postal address.
* Show that youâ€™re an authorized representative by verifying through a phone number, email, or domain.

**Note:** The email address used for verification must be a **business-authorized email** (e.g., name@yourcompany.com). Personal email domains such as **@gmail.com** or **@yahoo.com** are **not accepted** for business verification.
