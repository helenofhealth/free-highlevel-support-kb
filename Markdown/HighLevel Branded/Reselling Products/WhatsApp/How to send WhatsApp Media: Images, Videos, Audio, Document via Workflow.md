# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

  
**Q1: When can I send WhatsApp media messages?**  
**A:** Media messages can only be sent while the 24-hour **Customer Service Window** is open. The window opens each time the customer sends an inbound WhatsApp message and lasts for 24 hours from the timestamp of that message.

---

**Q2: Are media messages free inside the 24-hour window?**  
**A:** Yes. All media (images, videos, documents, and audio) sent during an open service window incur **no additional cost** and you may send an **unlimited** number of media messages.

---

**Q3: What happens if I try to send media after the 24-hour window closes?**  
**A:** The media message will fail. To re-open the window, you must send a **WhatsApp template** (marketing or utility) that is approved for outbound messaging to the customer.

---

**Q4: What media file sizes are allowed?**

* **Images:** JPEG or PNG ≤ 5 MB
* **Videos:** MP4 or 3GP ≤ 16 MB (H.264 video + AAC audio)
* **Audio:** AAC, AMR, MP3, M4A, or OGG (OPUS) ≤ 16 MB
* **Documents:** TXT, PDF, DOC/X, PPT/X, XLS/X ≤ 100 MB

Trying to send files larger than these limits will result in an error from the WhatsApp API.

---

**Q5: Can I add captions to every media type?**  
**A:** Captions are supported for **images, videos, and documents**. Captions are **not** supported for **audio** files; any text entered in the caption field for audio will be ignored.
