**Pre-Requisites for WhatsApp Setup**

  
**1\. Connect Your Agency Stripe Account**

  
To resell WhatsApp to clients, your **agency Stripe account** must be connected. This allows you to collect WhatsApp subscription payments directly from your sub-accounts.

  
➡ [How to Connect Stripe to Agency](#)

  
> **Note:**

> If you do not connect Stripe, you can still deploy WhatsApp using **Direct Deploy**. However, in this case, the subscription fee will be charged directly to your **agency card on file**, and the reselling feature will not be available.

---

**2\. Enable Reselling**

  
In your **Agency Settings > Reselling tab**, you can:

 • Offer WhatsApp as a service

 • Set your custom pricing for sub-accounts

  
This enables you to charge clients a markup while HighLevel charges your agency a fixed rate—allowing you to earn profit on each subscription.

---

**3\. Facebook Business Setup**

  
To set up WhatsApp in a sub-account, you need:

 • A **Facebook Account**

 • A **Meta Business Manager Account**

  
The onboarding flow will walk you through creating a **WhatsApp Business Account (WABA)** and a **Business Profile**, if you don’t already have one.

---

  
You will need a [Facebook Account](https://www.facebook.com/signup) and a [Facebook Meta Business Account](https://business.facebook.com/). (Learn what a Meta Business Account is [here](https://www.facebook.com/business/tools/meta-business-suite).)

# **Frequently Asked Questions**

  
## **Question: Can I use an LC/Twilio number on WhatsApp even if my A2P 10DLC registration is incomplete?**

  
### **Answer:** Yes, you can use the number to register on WhatsApp. However, it is highly recommended that you complete the A2P 10DLC registration for better compliance and reliability.
  
  
## **Question: How do I set up call forwarding on my LC/Twilio number for WhatsApp verification?**

  
### **Answer:** After purchasing the phone number from HighLevel, go to Phone Numbers > Click Add Number > Select the number and proceed to buy. Then, set up call forwarding to your number to ensure you receive the verification code during WhatsApp registration.

  
## **Question: I received an error message stating that the number is registered to an existing WhatsApp account. What should I do next?**

  
![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155027471137/original/kPQIZh_lGyO51atsprXMwaxLZ8SPwhgItA.png?1718111947)

  
**Answer:**

  
This error usually occurs in two situations:

1. **Active WhatsApp Account on Your Mobile Device:**  
If you currently have an active WhatsApp account on your mobile device, you need to delete that account to connect with the chat account. Follow these steps:  
   * Open the WhatsApp app.  
   * Navigate to Settings > Account > Delete my account.  
   * _Note:_ After integration, you will not be able to use WhatsApp on your phone, and your previous conversation history and contacts will not be migrated  
   * [Learn More on how to Migrate an Existing WhatsApp Number to a Business Account](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/cloud-api/get-started/migrate-existing-whatsapp-number-to-a-business-account)
2. **WhatsApp Number Connected to Another Provider:**  
If your WhatsApp number is linked to another provider, you need to create a new WABA account and migrate your number to the new WABA account

  
## **Question: I am getting Message Undeliverable error**

### **Answer:**

Reasons can include:

* The recipient phone number is not a WhatsApp phone number.
* Sending an authentication template to a WhatsApp user who has a +91 country calling code (India). Authentication templates currently cannot be sent to WhatsApp users in India.
* The message was not delivered to create a high quality user experience. See [Per-User Marketing Template Message Limits](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/cloud-api/guides/send-message-templates#per-user-marketing-template-message-limits).

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

  
**Q: Do I need to purchase the WhatsApp integration separately for each sub-account or agency?**

The $29.99/month WhatsApp integration is licensed at the agency level. If you manage multiple agency accounts, each one will require its own separate WhatsApp integration. The integration cannot be shared across different agency instances.
