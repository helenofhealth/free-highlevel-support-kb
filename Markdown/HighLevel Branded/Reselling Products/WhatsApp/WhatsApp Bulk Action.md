## Q: What is Meta Messaging Limit

  
Messaging limits on Meta control the maximum number of new, business-initiated conversations you can start with customers within a 24-hour rolling period.

Your quality rating reflects how well customers receive your messages over a 7-day period. Factors like user blocks, reports, and reasons for blocking impact this rating. A "Low" quality rating can decrease your messaging limit.

  
## Q How to maintain High Quality Rating

* Make sure messages follow the [WhatsApp Business Policy](https://www.whatsapp.com/legal/business-policy/?fbclid=IwAR3yDsNgje8Ks7%5Fmm7uCNbCirZ7VD8eR5%5F1u6cQYqbF7cIB%5Fe3eSZfzXxZc) and [Commerce Policy](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.whatsapp.com%2Flegal%2Fcommerce-policy%2F%3Ffbclid%3DIwAR3Sp4288z3r4lfjFgOwVzAaQj0iy0VZQxmDjuZFRgJR5ne1vJdqyEoC9KM&h=AT0nmsNykL5GCpxSlH5zjP9xRZ5JjgE5Jrlxk91m%5FQQTT0h-p0S%5F9JEqfLDCuwLTxJ336WYmForqeo%5FBSqaLBkuRpFatpZl%5FsnkX76GX4II6gjXy5IKElCjDix9ZdbTH8OTbW6BdDAH5QtL6FytQVJh%5Fr4c).
* Only send messages to users who have opted into receiving messages from your business.
* Make the messages highly personalized and useful to users. Avoid sending open-ended welcome or introductory messages.
* Be mindful of messaging frequency; avoid sending customers too many messages a day. Be thoughtful of informational messages, optimizing for content and length.
