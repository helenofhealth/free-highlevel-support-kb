# Why Does the “Payment Failed” Message Appear During WhatsApp Integration?

  
If a sub-account sees a **“Payment Failed”** message while trying to integrate WhatsApp, it’s most likely due to a **failed payment on the agency account**. WhatsApp subscriptions for sub-accounts are billed through the agency’s payment method, so any billing issue at the agency level will prevent successful integration.
  
  
To retry the failed payment on your agency account, follow these steps:

1. **Go to** Settings from the agency dashboard
2. Click on **Billing**
3. Navigate to the **Payments** tab
4. Click on **Invoices**
5. Locate the failed invoice and click **Retry Payment**

Once the payment is successfully processed, sub-accounts will be able to continue with the WhatsApp integration.
