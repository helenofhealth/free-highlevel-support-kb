# Agency Setup

  
**Pre-requisites for Auto-Reselling**

Connect your Agency Stripe Account

Your agency Stripe account will be used to collect subscription payments for WhatsApp from your clients. You can connect your agency Stripe account to your agency by following this helpful article: [How to Connect Stripe to Agency](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/48001171910-how-to-connect-stripe-to-your-agency-dashboard).

  
Note: You can also [Direct Deploy WhatsApp](#Direct-Deployment-%28Skipping-Rebilling%29) if you do not have a Stripe connected. However, this will charge your agency Card on file, skipping the reselling feature.

**Setting Up Reselling**

In the reselling tab of agency settings, you can offer WhatsApp and set your pricing for subaccounts. This allows you to charge your clients a markup while HighLevel bills you at a fixed rate. When a client wants to, they can then purchase WhatsApp at this marked-up price. Allowing you to recoup the HighLevel price we charge you and then make a profit every month.

After setting this up in the Agency, a Sub-Account can purchase it themselves, which will then charge the card on file for that Sub-Account.

## Direct Deployment (Skipping Reselling the WhatsApp subscription)

If you want to skip the reselling, that is if you do want, your sub accounts to pay the WhatsApp subscription charges, you can direct deploy WhatsApp to a specific Sub-Account without reselling markups, you can do this from the Manage Sub-Account Tab. This will charge your Agency Card on file, located in your Company Billing Tab. 

  
Navigate to the Agency View > Sub-Accounts > Find the Sub-Account, then click Manage Sub-Account

# WhatsApp Conversations

Unless a customer sends you a message, you must utilize a Template to send a new message to a customer. In general, there are two ways to open a WhatsApp conversation (1) when a customer messages you or (2) when you message a template to a customer.

  
## Types of WhatsApp Conversations

* **Business-Initiat** **ed:** Messages sent by businesses to customers using a template. There are four categories of templates and the templates are created and reviewed by Facebook Meta before they can be used. You can only send templates to customers until they respond, if they do not respond, you can only send templates.
* **Customer-Initiated:** Messages initiated by the customers sending a message to the business. When a customer messages you, it opens up a 24-hour window where you can send any template or free-form message to them.
* **Free Entry Conversations:** Initiated when customers interact with a WhatsApp Ad or a Facebook Business Page WhatsApp Action Button, allowing for a 72-hour window for businesses to respond. The business must respond within 24 hours of customer free point entry, after the business responds, the 72-hour timer begins.

## **Conversation (Template) Categories**

First, you [create a WhatsApp template in HighLevel](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/155000000861-how-to-create-a-whatsapp-template-). The template will be reviewed and approved (or denied) by Facebook Meta. Below we will review the types of template categories.

  
* **Marketing** — Enables you to achieve a wide range of goals, from generating awareness to driving sales and retargeting customers. Examples include new product, service, or feature announcements, targeted promotions/offers, and cart abandonment reminders.
* **Utility** — Enables you to follow-up on user actions or requests. Examples include opt-in confirmation, order/delivery management (e.g., delivery update); account updates or alerts (e.g., payment reminder); or feedback surveys.
* **Authentication (To be Released)** — This enables you to authenticate users with one-time passcodes, potentially at multiple steps in the login process (e.g., account verification, account recovery, integrity challenges).
* **Service (To be Released)** — Enables you to resolve customer inquiries.

Conversations are opened when you send a template message or free-form message under the following conditions.

  
**\[Business-Initiated\] Marketing, Utility, and Authentication Conversations**

Marketing, utility, and authentication conversations are opened when you send an approved marketing, utility, or authentication template message to a customer and no open conversation with that category exists between you and that customer.

  
For example, if an open authentication conversation exists between you and a customer and you send them another authentication template message within 24 hours, a new conversation is not opened. If you send them a marketing message, however, a new marketing conversation is opened, resulting in two open conversations.

  
**\[Business-Initiated\] Service Conversations**

Service conversations are opened when you are within a customer service window, you send a free-form message to a customer, and no open conversation of any category exists between you and the customer.

  
For example, if an open conversation of any category exists between you and a customer and you send them a free-form message within 24 hours, no new conversation is opened. However, if no open conversation exists and the customer messages you (which starts a customer service window) and you reply within 24 hours with a free-form message, a new service conversation is opened.

  
**\[Customer-Initiated\] Customer Service Windows**

When a customer messages you, a 24-hour timer called a customer service window starts. If you are within the window, you can send free-form messages or template messages. If you are outside the window, you can only send template messages.

  
**Multiple Conversations**

It is possible to have multiple open conversations between you and a customer. This can happen in the following situations:

  
An open marketing, utility, or authentication conversation exists between you and a customer and you send them a template message of a different category within 24 hours.

An open service conversation exists between you and a customer and you send them a template message within 24 hours.

  
**Duration of Conversations**

Marketing, utility, authentication, and service conversations last 24 hours unless closed by a newly opened free-entry point conversation.

  
Free-entry point conversations last 72 hours.

# WhatsApp Pricing

Unlike SMS, WhatsApp charges per conversation. Only business-initiated conversations are charged. The charge varies depending on the Template Category and country.
