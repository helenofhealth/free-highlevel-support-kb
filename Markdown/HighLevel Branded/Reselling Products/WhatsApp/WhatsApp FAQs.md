## Q. Failed to send a message because this user's phone number is part of an experiment

  
Starting June 14, 2023, roughly 1% of WhatsApp users will not receive marketing template messages from any business unless one of the following conditions is met:

* a [customer service window](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/pricing#customer-service-windows) exists between the customer and the business
* an open [marketing conversation](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/pricing#conversation-categories) exists between the customer and the business
* an open [free-entry point conversation](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/pricing#free-entry-point-conversations) exists between the customer and the business

If you send a marketing template message to a customer who is part of the experiment group, your message will not be sent and you will not be billed for it since no conversation was created

## Q. Will unsubscribing from WhatsApp affect my phone numbers and templates?

  
No, unsubscribing from WhatsApp will not impact your WhatsApp phone numbers or templates. When you resubscribe, all your numbers and templates will be restored as they were before unsubscribing.

## Q. What happens to my WhatsApp numbers and templates if I switch between "Location Purchase" and "Agency Direct Deploy"?

  
Switching between "Location Purchase" and "Agency Direct Deploy" will not affect your WhatsApp phone numbers or templates. Once you resubscribe, everything will appear as it was before the change.

## Q. Can I send or receive messages while my WhatsApp subscription is inactive?
  
  
No, messages cannot be sent or received while the WhatsApp subscription is inactive. However, all data, including phone numbers and templates, will remain intact and will be restored upon resubscription.  
  
## Q. What should I do if I face issues after resubscribing to WhatsApp?
  
  
If your phone numbers or templates do not appear after resubscribing, please reach out to our support team for assistance.  
  
## Q. Will my workflows and automations linked to WhatsApp templates be preserved during the unsubscribed period?

  
Yes, all workflows and automations linked to your WhatsApp templates will remain intact. Once you resubscribe, these workflows will function as before.

**Note:** Ensure you resubscribe promptly to avoid disruptions in your messaging workflows.

##   

## Q. What steps do I need to take to use my existing WhatsApp number?

To use your existing number, you need to delete the existing WhatsApp account associated with that number. Follow these steps:

1. Open WhatsApp.
2. Go to Settings > Account > Delete my account. For more information, refer to the guide on how to [Migrate an Existing WhatsApp Number to a Business Account.](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/cloud-api/get-started/migrate-existing-whatsapp-number-to-a-business-account/)

  
## Q. Can I use my number on both the WhatsApp Business Platform and WhatsApp Business App simultaneously?

Yes you can using the WhatsApp Coexistence feature. The WhatsApp Coexistence feature allows businesses to use their existing WhatsApp Business App account with LeadConnector's advanced CRM tools powered by WhatsApp Cloud API.

## Q4: Will I lose my data after migrating my WhatsApp number to the WhatsApp Business Platform?

Yes, you will lose all data associated with WhatsApp after migration. Meta does not allow data transfers between the platforms. It is highly recommended to take a backup of your data before proceeding with the migration.

  
## Q5: How do I backup my data before migrating my WhatsApp number?

To backup your data:

1. Open WhatsApp.
2. Go to Settings > Chats > Chat backup.
3. Follow the prompts to back up your data to your preferred location (e.g., Google Drive or iCloud).

  
## Q. What is Meta’s new update for the WhatsApp Business Platform (API)?

  
Meta has introduced Frequency Capping to limit the number of marketing messages sent to WhatsApp users with Indian phone numbers. This restricts the number of marketing messages a person can receive from any business in a given period. Meta introduced frequency capping to reduce spamming and over-sending messages to WhatsApp users, improving the overall user experience and providing businesses a better opportunity to engage with customers effectively.

  
## Q. How does this impact your deliverability?

  
Frequency capping works on a first-come, first-served basis. Marketing messages will be delivered until the limit is reached. Any messages beyond this limit will not be delivered.

  
## Q. What kind of messages are exempt from Frequency Capping?

  
Frequency capping only applies to promotional and marketing template messages that require opening a new conversation. It does not apply to:

  
 • Session Messages: Support messages within existing customer service interactions.

 • Click to WhatsApp Ads: Conversations initiated by users clicking on WhatsApp ads.

  
## Q. Does Frequency Capping affect all users?

  
No, Frequency Capping only applies to marketing messages sent to users in India (+91 country code).

  
What determines the capping for a WhatsApp Business Account with multiple phone numbers?

  
The restriction is based on the total number of messages received by individual users from any business. It is not determined by the number of messages received from one specific business.

  
## Q. What are the benefits of verifying my Facebook Business Manager account?

Once Meta verifies your Facebook Business Manager account, you can initiate unlimited business conversations on WhatsApp.

  
## Q. What can I do if my Facebook Business Manager account is not yet verified?

While your verification is pending, you can:

* Initiate up to 250 business conversations in a 24-hour rolling window.
* Respond to customer-initiated conversations without any restrictions.
* Have two WhatsApp business numbers in an unverified Facebook Business Manager account.

  
## Q. What happens if my business verification is unsuccessful?

If your business verification is unsuccessful, you can continue using your WhatsApp business number with the restrictions mentioned (i.e., 250 business conversations in a 24-hour period and responding to customer-initiated conversations without restrictions).

  
## Q. How do I request verification for my Facebook Business Manager account?

To request verification, you need to provide proof of your legal entity and access to the business. Detailed instructions can be found in the guide on [Verifying your Business in WhatsApp Business Manager](http://Q1:%20What%20are%20the%20benefits%20of%20verifying%20my%20Facebook%20Business%20Manager%20account?%20%20Once%20Meta%20verifies%20your%20Facebook%20Business%20Manager%20account,%20you%20can%20initiate%20unlimited%20business%20conversations%20on%20WhatsApp.%20%20Q2:%20What%20can%20I%20do%20if%20my%20Facebook%20Business%20Manager%20account%20is%20not%20yet%20verified?%20%20While%20your%20verification%20is%20pending,%20you%20can:%20%20Initiate%20up%20to%20250%20business%20conversations%20in%20a%2024-hour%20rolling%20window.%20Respond%20to%20customer-initiated%20conversations%20without%20any%20restrictions.%20Have%20two%20WhatsApp%20business%20numbers%20in%20an%20unverified%20Facebook%20Business%20Manager%20account.%20Q3:%20What%20happens%20if%20my%20business%20verification%20is%20unsuccessful?%20%20If%20your%20business%20verification%20is%20unsuccessful,%20you%20can%20continue%20using%20your%20WhatsApp%20business%20number%20with%20the%20restrictions%20mentioned%20%28i.e.,%20250%20business%20conversations%20in%20a%2024-hour%20period%20and%20responding%20to%20customer-initiated%20conversations%20without%20restrictions%29.%20%20Q4:%20How%20do%20I%20request%20verification%20for%20my%20Facebook%20Business%20Manager%20account?%20%20To%20request%20verification,%20you%20need%20to%20provide%20proof%20of%20your%20legal%20entity%20and%20access%20to%20the%20business.%20Detailed%20instructions%20can%20be%20found%20in%20the%20guide%20on%20Verifying%20your%20Business%20in%20WhatsApp%20Business%20Manager.).
  
  
## Q. What are the recommended best practices to improve deliverability?

  
Opt-In Engagement: Send messages only to customers who have explicitly opted-in.

* Segment Your Contact List: Group your audience based on common characteristics to send targeted messages.
* Personalize Recommendations: Use customer behavior and purchase patterns to send personalized product recommendations.
* Emphasize Quality Over Quantity: Ensure your messages add value and resonate with your customers’ needs.
* Engage via Two-Way Conversations: Create meaningful interactions to keep customers engaged and interested in your brand.

  
## Q. WhatsApp is free to use for personal messaging. So, what do "WhatsApp conversation charges" refer to?

  
While the WhatsApp app and WhatsApp Business app are free, businesses using the WhatsApp Business API to communicate with customers at scale are subject to conversation charges. 

These charges apply when a business sends notifications to customers via the WhatsApp Business platform, especially if the customer has not responded within the last 24 hours. The cost depends on the customer's country code. We bill these charges to you based on the actual cost, with no additional surcharge.
  
  
## Q: What does “Last onboarding failed! This WABA is already onboarded at this Location ID” mean?

This message indicates that the WABA (WhatsApp Business Account) you’re trying to onboard is already connected to another Location ID, as shown in the error message or screenshot. If you’d like to onboard this WABA to a different Location ID, you’ll first need to disconnect it from the current Location. Once it’s removed, you can proceed with onboarding it to the desired Location ID.
