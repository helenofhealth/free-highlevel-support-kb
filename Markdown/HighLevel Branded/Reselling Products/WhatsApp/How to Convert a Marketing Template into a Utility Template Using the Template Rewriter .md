Please Note:If Meta does not approve the template you need to manually create the template and change the content

#   

# FAQ:

  
### **Q1: Can I change a template’s category directly from Marketing to Utility?**

  
No. WhatsApp does not allow direct category changes. You must use the **Template Rewriter** to revise and resubmit the template.

---

### **Q2: Will the same template name work for the new Utility version?**

  
If the template is already approved as Marketing, you’ll need to **use a different name** for the revised Utility version.

---

### **Q3: How long does Meta take to approve the rewritten template?**

  
Approval can take **up to 24–48 hours**, but it’s usually quicker if the content is clearly compliant.

---

### **Q4: What if the template is rejected again?**

  
Check the **rejection reason** in your WhatsApp template dashboard, refine the content further, and resubmit.

---

### **Q5: Do Utility templates cost less or have different delivery rules?**

  
Yes. Utility templates **within a 24-hour service window** are often **free**, and they bypass user opt-out restrictions applicable to Marketing messages.
