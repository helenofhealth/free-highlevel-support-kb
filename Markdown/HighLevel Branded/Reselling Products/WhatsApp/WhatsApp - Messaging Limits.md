# Increasing WhatsApp Messaging Limit

  
Note that in order for your business phone number to be eligible for an increase, it must have a [connected status](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/cloud-api/phone-numbers#phone-number-status), and if your business phone number has a [low quality](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/896873687365001) rating, it may continue to be limited to 250 business-initiated conversations until its quality rating improves.

###   

## **Business Verification**

Submit your business for [business verification](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/2058515294227817). If your business is approved, Meta will analyze your [messaging quality](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/messaging-limits/#messaging-quality) to determine if your messaging activity warrants an increase to your messaging limit. Based on this analysis, Meta will then either [approve](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/messaging-limits/#increase-approvals) or [deny](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/messaging-limits/#increase-denials) a messaging limit increase.

## **Identity Verification**

  
If you submit your business for verification and are approved, you may be asked to [verify your identity](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/587323819101032).

If you are asked to verify your identity, the [**WhatsApp Manager**](https://business.facebook.com/wa/manage/home/) \> **Overview** \> **Limits** panel will display the following notification:

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155024896857/original/Wx2M0OQXVaph-NQfMHg-_8C_KrDjEvQAUA.png?1713854985)

  
If you complete identity verification and your identity is confirmed, Meta will [approve](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/messaging-limits/#increase-approvals) a messaging limit increase. If your identity is not confirmed, Meta will [deny](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/messaging-limits/#increase-denials) a messaging limit increase, and 

[](https://business.facebook.com/wa/manage/home/)

[**WhatsApp Manager**](https://business.facebook.com/wa/manage/home/) > **Overview** > **Limits** panel

  
will display one the following notifications:

## **Open 1K Conversations in 30 Days**

  
Open 1,000 or more business-initiated conversations in a 30-day moving period using templates with a [high quality rating](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/896873687365001). Once you reach this threshold, Meta will analyze your [messaging quality](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/messaging-limits/#messaging-quality) to determine if your messaging activity warrants an increase to your messaging limit. Based on this analysis, Meta will then either [approve](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/messaging-limits/#increase-approvals) or [deny](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/messaging-limits/#increase-denials) an increase.

## **Send High-Quality Messages**

  
If you are rejected for business or identity verification, ensure that you are sending high-quality messages. Meta will periodically reevaluate your messaging activity and quality and based on this analysis, may [approve](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/messaging-limits/#increase-approvals) an increase.

Here are some guidelines for sending high-quality messages:

* Make sure messages follow the [WhatsApp Business Messaging Policy](https://business.whatsapp.com/policy?fbclid=IwZXh0bgNhZW0CMTEAAR32s0sx7BV-s-H2qLRdlqPXowSfdAkcyu451sDhd3zojoWkvitoHdYC2TE%5Faem%5FAfXsqBIoXPdFha8AAq55fELrm7Un-QpMMQ17WTmh0CwRmBaXtDvBlWzZawuXFlsEjajqzvRZCFVKtKSCpHIdgdkX).
* Only send messages to users who have opted into receiving messages from your business.
* Make the messages highly personalized and useful to users. Avoid sending open-ended welcome or introductory messages.
* Be mindful of messaging frequency; avoid sending customers too many messages a day. Be thoughtful of informational messages, optimizing for content and length.

## **Request an Increase**

  
If you completed business verification or identity verification, or have met the 1K conversations in 30 days threshold, but are still limited to 250 business-initiated conversations, you can open a direct support ticket and request a messaging tier upgrade 

**Ask a Question** > **WABiz: Phone Number & Registration** > **Request type** > **Request a Messaging Tier Upgrade**

  
Based on your support submission and [messaging quality](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/messaging-limits/#messaging-quality), Meta will either [approve](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/messaging-limits/#increase-approvals) or [deny](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/messaging-limits/#increase-denials) an increase.
