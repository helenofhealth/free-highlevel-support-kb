## What Are Association Limits?

  
Association limits let you control how many records can be linked together between objects. These rules ensure data remains organized, prevent over-association, and are now visually enforced in the UI.

Note: To enable this feature, go to Settings > Labs > Association Limits Handling, and toggle it on.

## 

Please note that Custom Objects are only visible on the 497 plan.

## What Are Association Limits?

  
* Avoids over-linking between records.
* Helps keep data structures clean.
* Reduces user confusion when the limits are reached with clear UI feedback.
  
  
## Supported Relationship Types

  
### For multi-label associations:

* One-to-One (1:1)
* One-to-N (where N ≤ 1000)
* One-to-Many
* Many-to-Many

### For single-label contact-to-contact associations:

* One-to-One (1:1)
* Many-to-Many
* Custom N-to-N

Note: Limits are enforced per label and reflected in the user interface.

## Example: Real Estate Management

A real estate agency wants to ensure that each Agent manages no more than 50 Properties:

* Create a one-to-N relationship from Agent to Property
* Set the limit as N = 50
* When an agent hits this cap, users will see a UI warning and can no longer assign more properties, ensuring balanced workloads.

## Association Limits:

* If you try to associate beyond the allowed count, an error message will be shown instantly, this helps in clear and efficient management of the data-structures
