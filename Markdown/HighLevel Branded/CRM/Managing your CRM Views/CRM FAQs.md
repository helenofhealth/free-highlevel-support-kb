# Sample Data in CRM

### **Can I remove or modify the sample data provided in my new subaccount?**

Yes, you can easily customize, edit, or delete any sample data at any time.

  
### **What if I don't have a default pipeline set for my location?**

If your location doesn't have a default pipeline, sample Opportunities and Pipelines won't be created. However, you'll still receive sample data for Contacts, Tasks, Notes, Companies, and Tags.

  
### **Will existing subaccounts receive this sample data?**

No, existing subaccounts will remain unchanged. This feature applies only to newly created subaccounts.

  
### **How do I identify sample data in my CRM?**

All sample data records are clearly prefixed with "(Example)" to differentiate them from your actual data.
