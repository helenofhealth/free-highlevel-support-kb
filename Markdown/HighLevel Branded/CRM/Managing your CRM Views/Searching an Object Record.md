## Feature 4 - Regex Search

Users can take advantage of regex for more tailored searches.  
  
However, please note that regex will not work on fields like contact names, phone numbers, monetary values, numeric fields and other similar fields.  
Regex supports:

* `*abc`: Searches for records ending with "abc."
* `*abc*`: Searches for records containing "abc."
* `abc*`: Searches for records starting with "abc."

Regex search does not work on fields like contact name, phone numbers and monetary values
