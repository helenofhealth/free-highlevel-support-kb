# **What is Unified Task Management?**

  
Unified Task Management in HighLevel allows you to create and manage tasks from both the Contacts and Opportunities modules using the same interface. The system offers a clean layout, powerful filters, and advanced task options—making it easier to stay on top of your to-dos regardless of where you work inside the platform.

  
In the Contacts module, you can access the task panel from within a contact’s detailed view to create, view, and manage tasks directly associated with that individual.

  
In the Opportunities module, clicking into any opportunity record opens a similar task panel, allowing you to manage tasks that are tied to that specific deal or pipeline stage—using the same familiar interface.

## **Key Benefits of Unified Task Management**

  
* **Consistent Interface Across Modules:** Tasks look and function the same whether you’re working from a Contact or Opportunity record, minimizing confusion and standardizing task handling.
* **Simplified Task Creation:** A clean and organized task form helps users enter task details quickly, with clearly labeled fields for title, description, due date, and assignee.
* **Recurring Task Options:** Set up tasks to repeat on a schedule, allowing automation of ongoing reminders or processes without additional manual effort.
* **Centralized Filtering and Search:** Locate tasks easily with built-in filters and a search bar that work across all task views—no matter the module.
* **Quick Task Edits:** Open and edit tasks directly using a unified layout, making updates simple and accessible.

### **Recurring Tasks**

  
To configure a recurring task, first toggle on the **Recurring tasks** option. Then use the **Repeats every** field to define how frequently the task should recur—for example, every X days, weeks, or months. Under **Ends on**, choose whether the task should repeat indefinitely (**Never**), stop on a specific date (**On**), or after a certain number of repetitions (**After**). You can also enable the option to **create a new task even if the previous task is overdue**, which ensures that the recurrence continues on schedule regardless of completion status. This setup is ideal for automating repetitive actions and maintaining consistent follow-up.
