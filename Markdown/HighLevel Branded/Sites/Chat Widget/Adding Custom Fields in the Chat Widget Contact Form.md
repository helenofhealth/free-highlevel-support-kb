What does this include -

* Custom Field Addition: Users can now add custom fields in contact within the chat widget builder, in addition to the standard fields. These custom fields allow businesses to collect additional information during interactions with customers using SMS/Email and WhatsApp Chat Widget type.
* Standard Fields: The chat widget will continue to support the following standard fields:  
   * Name (mandatory)  
   * Phone or Email (one is required to create contacts) Note - (Default will be Phone if tried to remove)  
   * Message

   * MULTI LINE  
   * MONETARY  
   * NUMERIC  
   * PHONE  
   * DATE PICKER  
   * DROPDOWN (SINGLE)
* Field Limitations: Users can add a total of up to 5 fields, which includes both the standard and custom fields. \[Either Phone or Email are mandatory\]
* Field Validation & Mandatory Fields:  
   * Standard Fields (Name, Phone, Email, and Message) will always be mandatory when added.  
   * Custom fields are not required to be filled during submission unless data is entered.  
   * Input validation applies for custom fields, where:  
   * Phone fields are validated based on country code.  
   * Email fields are validated for correct email format.
* Phone Field Internationalization: If two or more phone number fields are added, the chat widget allows the user to select a country code for international phone number formatting. However, only one country flag can be selected for all phone fields. If a user changes the country flag in one field, it will automatically update the flag in the other phone field(s).
