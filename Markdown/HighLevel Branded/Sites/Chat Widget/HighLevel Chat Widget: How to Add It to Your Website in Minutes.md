## **How to Set Up and Test the Chat Widget**
  
  
**Step 1:** Once you have a chat widget set up, you'll want to configure a Workflow Trigger to notify when a conversation is initiated via the chat widget. 

  
To do this, the trigger event should be "**Customer Replied**" with a filter for "**Reply Channel**" set to "**Chat Widget**" like this:

**Every** "**Reply channel**" will require its own respective trigger. For the example above we are only using "**Chat Widget**", if you wanted to use[ Google Messages](https://help.gohighlevel.com/en/support/solutions/articles/48001176043) you would need to setup a NEW trigger and or workflow for that specific event.
  
  
**Step 2:**Next click the **\+ >** Search for **"Internal notifications" >** You can select from 3 options:

  
**1.** Email - Send email to a specific Users or custom email  
  
**2\.** In-app notification - Send a notification via the web app or mobile app to a specific Users or all

**3.** SMS - Send SMS to a specific Users or custom number 

  
**Quick Tip:** 

  
Use the "**{{m** **essage.body}}**" custom value in your notification email/text to display the message that the user entered into the chat widget.
