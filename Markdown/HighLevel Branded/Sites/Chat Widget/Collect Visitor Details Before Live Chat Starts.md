# **What is the Contact Form in Chat Widget?**

  
The Contact Form is a pre-chat prompt that appears inside the Live Chat widget. Before a visitor can type a message, they’re asked to provide their contact details. This ensures you always know who you’re talking to and can follow up after the conversation ends.
