3\. With the WhatsApp chat option, go to widget window to do the customization of text, colors, branding and forms with email/phone. With Whatsapp chat type, it will use the whatsapp colors in shades of green and user can configure their own colors.

**How It Works**

1\. Add the code to the landing page (external providers) to header code or use it by enabling toggle in Funnel/Website Settings

2\. When the chat widget is embedded, it will display on the landing page once it loads in a browser window.

3\. When the contact visits the page, completes, and submits the form, it will redirect the contact to the WhatsApp web app with the message to the number selected in widget window.

4\. You will then receive a notification in the "Conversations" view and be able to message the contact.
