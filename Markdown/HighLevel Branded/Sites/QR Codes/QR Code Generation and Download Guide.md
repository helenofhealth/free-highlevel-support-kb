## **Cropped QR Codes and Transparent PNGs**

  
* If no background, header, or footer is added, the QR code is automatically trimmed. This ensures a cleaner, more compact appearance.
* True Transparency for PNGs: Create seamless integrations! PNG QR codes can now be generated with 100% transparency. This makes it easy to overlay the QR code onto existing designs or backgrounds in your favourite image editor. To create a transparent PNG, adjust the background color alpha slider to the far left (0% opacity) within the QR code builder.
