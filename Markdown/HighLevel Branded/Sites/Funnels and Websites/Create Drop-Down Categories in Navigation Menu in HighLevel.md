# **What Are Categories in the Navigation Menu?**

  
Creating categories in your navigation menu means grouping related menu items under a single parent item, forming a drop-down menu. This allows you to structure your navigation for clarity and efficiency. In HighLevel, this is done with a simple drag-and-drop indentation method inside the Navigation Menu element.
