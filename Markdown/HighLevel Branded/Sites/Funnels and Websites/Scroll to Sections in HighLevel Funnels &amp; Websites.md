## **Setting Up Scroll to Element**

  
Learn how to scroll to a specific section using a simple selector-based linking method. Once you copy the selector, you can use it with text, buttons, or menu items.

  
### **Step 1:** Copy the CSS Selector  
  
Every scroll-to setup starts with getting the selector of the section you want to scroll to. You’ll paste this selector at the end of your link in Step 2.

  
1. Open your funnel or website in the builder.
2. Click on the section you want to scroll to.
3. In the right-hand panel, go to the **Advanced** tab.
4. Copy the value shown in the **CSS Selector** field.

### **Step 2:** Choose a Scroll Method  
  
Now that you have the CSS selector, choose one of the following methods to activate the scroll behavior when users click.
  
  
#### **Method 1:** Hyperlink Text to a Section  
  
Turn text into a clickable scroll link using the copied selector.

  
1. Highlight the desired text.
2. Click the **Link icon** in the formatting toolbar.
3. Enter your full page URL + the CSS selector you copied. (Example: _www.yourdomain.com/#section\_abc12_)

**Q: Will this work on mobile?**  
Yes, the scroll functionality works across devices.  
  
**Q: My scroll isn’t working. What should I do?**  
Check that your selector is correct and that it starts with `#`. Refresh the page and test again.
