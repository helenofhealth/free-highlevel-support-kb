## **How Authorization works:**

  
* This is **not** turned on by default and will require a couple quick extra steps, covered below
* The system will remove the monetary value placed in the "authorize amount" from the clients bank account before crediting it back later.
* If the account does not have the funds during the authorization process, they will not be allowed to continue to the next step.
* Upon authorization approval the system will credit back the account for the amount used to authorize.
* If you have any "Trial days" attached to the plan those will also kick in as soon as the card is authorized.
* Funds may take up to 5 business days before being return to the clients bank account
* **ONLY** works with Subscriptions and Payment plans.

**Note:** 

If you would like to authorize payment before purchase for all your plans, this process will need to be repeated for each plan attached to the payment form.
