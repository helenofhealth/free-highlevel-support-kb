## **What are Nested Layouts?**

  
Nested Layouts allow you to place layout containers within other layout containers, giving you precise control over how elements are structured on a page. This structure enables you to easily manage multi-column designs, adaptive spacing, and responsive sections with enhanced visual control.

  
Whether you’re creating opt-in pages, comparison tables, or product showcases, Nested Layouts simplify the process while enhancing visual consistency and alignment.

## **How To Set Up Nested Layouts in the Builder**

  
Nested Layouts are easy to implement using the Funnel or Website Builder’s drag-and-drop interface. Here’s how to get started:

  
1. Log in to your subaccount and open your desired Funnel or Website.
2. Drag a **Layout Container** onto the canvas.
3. Drag a second Layout Container into the first to form the nested structure.
4. Open **Layout Settings** and choose **row**, **column**, or **collage** orientation.
5. Adjust **Spacing & Alignment** for margins, padding, and positioning. Repeat steps 3–5 for additional nested levels as needed.
6. Click **Save** to commit your layout or add it to **Saved Sections** for reuse.

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

  
**Q: How do I add a nested container?**  
Drag a Layout Container into an existing Layout Container—the blue highlight shows a valid drop zone.
  
  
**Q: Can I nest Sections or Rows?**  
No. Only **Layout Containers** can be nested. Sections and Rows remain single‑level for performance reasons.
  
  
**Q: Is there a depth limit?**  
Practically no, but we recommend three to four levels for maintainability and load speed.
  
  
**Q: Do Nested Layouts work in Saved Sections and Funnels?**  
Yes. Saved Sections keep their nested structure and sync globally when updated.
