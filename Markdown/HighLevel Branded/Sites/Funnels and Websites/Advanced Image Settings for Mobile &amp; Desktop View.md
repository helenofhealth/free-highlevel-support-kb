# **What Are Image Dimensions Settings?**

  
Image dimension settings allow you to adjust image dimensions independently for mobile and desktop views. You can specify height and width for images in mobile layouts, ensuring that visuals look sharp and consistent across devices.

  
It also supports multiple units for measurement, including pixels (px), relative units (rem, em), and percentages (%), for greater design flexibility.

### **Step 3:** Adjust Image Dimensions

* In the image settings panel, locate the **Height** and **Width** fields.
* Enter the desired values for the image dimensions.
* Select your preferred unit of measurement:  
   * **px** for fixed pixel dimensions.  
   * **rem** or **em** for scalable dimensions relative to font size.  
   * **%** for relative dimensions based on container size.

  
**Note:** To set different image dimensions for mobile and desktop, use the view toggle at the top of the builder to switch between views. Enter height and width values while in each specific view—changes made in mobile view apply only to mobile, and those made in desktop view apply only to desktop. This allows you to optimize image sizing separately for each device.

# **Frequently Asked Questions**

  
**Q: What happens if I don’t set specific dimensions for mobile views?**

If you don’t specify mobile dimensions, the image will use the desktop dimensions by default, which may not be optimized for smaller screens.
  
  
**Q: How do I choose the best unit for image dimensions?**

* Use **px** for precise, fixed dimensions.
* Use **rem** or **em** for scalable designs relative to text size.

**Q: Can I use different units for height and width?**

Yes, you can mix and match units for height and width. For example, set the height in **pixels (px)** and the width in **percentages (%)** based on your design needs.
  
  
**Q: Will this feature affect my existing images?**

No, existing images will retain their current dimensions unless you modify them. You can adjust the dimensions for individual images as needed.
