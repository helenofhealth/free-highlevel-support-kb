##   
**How Authorization works:**

  
* This, by default, is **not** turned on and will require a couple of quick extra steps, covered below.
* The system will remove the monetary value placed in the "authorized amount" from the client's bank account before crediting it later.
* If the account does not have the funds during the authorization process, they will not be allowed to continue to the next step.
* Upon authorization approval, the system will credit back the account for the amount used to authorize.
* If you have any "Trial days" attached to the plan, those will kick in as soon as the card is authorized.
* Funds may take up to 5 business days before being returned to the clients bank account.
* It **ONLY** works with Subscriptions and Payment plans.

**Note:** 

If you would like to authorize payment before purchase for all your plans, this process will need to be repeated for each plan attached to the payment form.

In this example, there are two plans where "Authorized payments" will need to be turned on (Monthly $149 & Yearly $1490).

**5\. Type the dollar amount you would like to "authorize."**

  
**Please Note:**

The refund process may take up to 5 business days before returning the amount taken.Â
