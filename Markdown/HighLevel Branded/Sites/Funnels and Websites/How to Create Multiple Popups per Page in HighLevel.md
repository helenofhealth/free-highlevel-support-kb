## **Customizing Popup Appearance & Positioning**

  
Customize how each popup looks and where it shows up on your page to align precisely with your design and engagement goals. Every pop-up has the same design tools you use on sections. Use the options within Popup Settings to customize each popup individually.

  
* **Popup Positioning:** Set the popup location to left, center, or right within popup settings
* **Visual Customization:** Modify background color, overlays, spacing, and content elements, just like regular page sections
* **Spacing & Sizing:** Adjust padding, margins, and max width for desktop, tablet, and mobile
* **Popup Triggers:** Choose specific triggers for each popup, including delay, exit-intent, or interaction-based triggers such as clicks on buttons, images, or text links

---

## **Setting Popup Triggers**

  
Control precisely when and how each popup is displayed by setting triggers. Triggers determine exactly when (or why) each pop-up appears. Below are the available trigger options:  
  
* **Delay:** Choose a time in seconds after the page loads
* **Exit Intent:** Trigger a popup when the visitor attempts to leave your page
* **None:** Manually triggered popups (usually linked to buttons, images, or text)

[Popups can also be triggered by clicking on linked buttons, images, or text.](#Linking-Popups-to-Buttons,-Images-&-Text)
  
  
#### **To Set a Trigger:**

  
1. Select the pop-up in the sidebar.
2. Open the Settings tab.
3. Under the **Show Popup On** dropdown, pick Delay, Exit Intent, or None (for click-only pop-ups).
4. If you chose Delay, enter the number of seconds.
