**Please Note:**

This is a domain connection feature, not a domain hosting feature. You need to have already purchased the domain in either Google Domains, Go Daddy, Cloudflare or IONOS for this to work.  
  
Incase of Cloudflare proxy, make sure your automatically created DNS records have Cloudflare proxy turned off.

Important: After the provider tab has been authorized, close it to proceed to the domain verification process.

## **FAQs**

### **Q: Can I still manually configure my domains if I prefer not to use Domain Connect?**

A: Yes, manual configuration is still an option for users who prefer to set up their DNS records manually or whose domain providers are not currently supported by Domain Connect.

  
### **Q: What if my domain provider is not one of the top three supported by Domain Connect?**

A: Users with domain providers not currently supported by Domain Connect can still manually add the required DNS records. The manual configuration process remains the same.

  
### **Q: What if I toggle on the option for "Also add www domain" but my www subdomain is already pointed to another system?**

A: CNAME record will be created for your sub-domain in your DNS records and pointed to us, but we will not be able to delete the existing CNAME or A record that you have for your www domain, pointed to another service. You will need to delete that yourself so that your www domain can work with us.
