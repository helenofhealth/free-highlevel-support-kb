# **What Is a Popup That Shows on Page Load?**

  
A page load popup is a type of message or form that automatically appears shortly after a visitor arrives on your website or funnel page—without them clicking or scrolling. This kind of popup is triggered by a timing setting (like a 2-second delay) and is used to grab the visitor’s attention right away. It’s commonly used to promote time-sensitive offers, capture leads, or display welcome messages that encourage action early in the visit.

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

  
**Q: Can I set the popup to show only once per visit or session?**  
No, the popup will appear each time the page loads unless the visitor stays on the same page.

  
**Q: What if I want the popup to show when someone tries to leave?**  
Use the "Exit" option on the "Show popup on" dropdown to create a popup that triggers when the user moves their cursor toward the browser toolbar.

  
**Q: Can I use this on both Funnels and Websites?**  
Yes! The feature works identically for both, and the setup process is exactly the same.

  
**Q: What happens if the popup is opened manually before the delay time is reached?**  
 If the popup is triggered manually (e.g., by a button click) before the delay timer finishes, the automatic popup will be canceled. This prevents the same popup from appearing twice during the same page view.
