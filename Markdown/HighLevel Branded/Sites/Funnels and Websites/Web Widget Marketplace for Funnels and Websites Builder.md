We’re excited to share a new feature that makes it easier for you to customize your online funnels, websites, stores, and blogs. Our new Web Widget Marketplace lets you find, install, and use small add-ons called “widgets” to make your website more engaging and unique. These widgets are created by other developers and can be quickly added to your pages to make them more interactive, useful, and eye-catching.

  
What Is the Web Widget Marketplace?  
  
The Web Widget Marketplace is like an app store but for small website add-ons, or “widgets.” Widgets are tools you can add to your Funnel/Website page, like Pricing Cards to display pricing details, Banners for announcements, and other interactive items. By adding widgets, you can make your site more engaging, boost conversions, and improve your visitors’ experience—all without needing advanced coding skills.

  
Real-World Example:

Imagine you have an online store and want to display a special discount. You can add a Banner widget to your homepage to announce the offer. If you run a blog, you could use an Email Signup widget to grow your subscriber list. These small changes can make a big difference in how visitors interact with your site.

  
Why Did We Build This Feature?

  
Many people want easy-to-use tools that don’t require hiring a developer or learning to code. The Web Widget Marketplace was designed to give you this flexibility, allowing you to quickly find and add the right widgets for your site. With these widgets, you can now personalize your website with just a few clicks to better fit your brand and goals.

Example Scenario:

Let’s say you’re running a fitness coaching website and want to offer a limited-time free trial. With the Countdown Timer widget, you could add a timer to your homepage that shows when the offer expires, creating a sense of urgency. Or if you want to show customer reviews to build trust, you could add a Testimonials widget.

By using the Web Widget Marketplace, you can quickly set up these engaging elements and help drive more actions from visitors—whether that’s clicking a “Sign Up” button, reading more blog posts, or making a purchase.  
  
Summing It Up

The Web Widget Marketplace is a great way to add personality and functionality to your site. Whether you’re building a business, sharing a passion project, or creating a blog, these widgets make it easy to design a unique site that engages your audience.
