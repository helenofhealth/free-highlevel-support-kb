# **What Is the Rich Text Element?**

  
The Rich Text Element empowers you with advanced formatting capabilities directly within the editor. The all-in-one text box brings advanced formatting including headings, block quotes, inline code, multi-level lists, and highlight colors.

  
Because everything lives in a single element while using the same sidebar as the Paragraph element, you can style content faster. Unlike basic paragraph elements, it allows you to seamlessly switch text styles, add block quotes, highlight text, and insert code blocks without needing custom HTML or CSS.

* **Markdown-Style Shortcuts:** Type >, \`code\`, or \`\`\` to auto-create quotes and code blocks
