## **How Authorization works:**

* This is **not** turned on by default and will require a couple of quick extra steps, covered below
* The system will remove the monetary value placed in the "authorized amount" from the client's bank account before crediting it back later.
* If the account does not have the funds during the authorization process, they will not be allowed to continue to the next step.
* Upon authorization approval, the system will credit back the account for the amount used to authorize.
* If you have any "**Trial days**" attached to the plan, those will kick in as soon as the card is authorized.
* Funds may take up to 5 business days before being returned to the client's bank account
* It **ONLY** works with Subscriptions and Payment plans.

  
**Please Note:** 

If you would like to authorize payment before purchase for all your plans, this process will need to be repeated for each plan attached to the payment form.

**2\. Click on the "Edit" icon**

This will open the product settings. In this example, there are two plans (monthly $149 & Annual $1490) where "Authorization" will need to be turned on.

**5\. Type the dollar amount you would like to "authorize"**

  
**Please Note:**

Keep in mind the amount you place here will be deducted from the clients account. If the funds are unavailable they will not be able to proceed.Â   
  
In this example: The system will take "$1" out of the clients account and then refund the "$1" back.  
  
The refund process may take up to 5 business days before returning the amount taken. Only works with subscription and payment plans
