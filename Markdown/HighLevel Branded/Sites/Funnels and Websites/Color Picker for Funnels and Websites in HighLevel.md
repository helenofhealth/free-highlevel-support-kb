# **What is the Color Picker?**

  
The Color Picker is the design component inside HighLevel’s Funnels & Websites Builder that controls every color you use, from section backgrounds to hyper-specific text highlights. It displays brand, default, and custom colors together, supports HEX, RGB, and custom values, and offers precise, per-character styling directly from the inline text toolbar.

---

## **Key Benefits of the Color Picker**

  
A unified interface and smart controls help you style pages faster and more consistently.  
  
* **Unified Palette**: View brand, default, and custom colors in a single panel, so there is no need to switch tabs
* **Per-Character Control**: Color a single word or letter for precise emphasis
* **Custom Labels**: Name colors (for example, “CTA Blue”) for quick reuse
* **Format Flexibility**: Enter and display colors in HEX, RGB, or custom values
* **Duplicate Protection**: Validation prevents accidental shade duplicates
* **Compact Layout**: Modern, space-efficient design loads quickly and stays out of your way

## **Per-Character and Per-Word Level Styling**

  
With the updated inline text editor, you can now apply color to individual words or even individual characters in your text. This means you can highlight specific words or change the color of just a part of the text, giving you full control over your design's look and feel.

---

## **Custom Color Labels & Tooltip**

  
Keep palettes organized, even when shades are similar, by giving your custom colors names!
  
  
#### **Naming Colors**

  
After picking a color, users can name and edit labels for custom colors (for example, “Warning Red”). Labels can be edited or removed at any time.

#### **Custom Label Tooltips**

  
Hovering over a custom color displays its label as a tooltip. This makes it easier to distinguish similar shades, so your team can pick the right tint without memorizing HEX codes.

## **Supported Color Formats**

  
The Color Picker allows you to choose and save colors in multiple formats so you can work with the values that best suit your needs. Use the dropdown to switch between color formats.  
  
* **HEX**: A six-character code that defines color (for example, #1E90FF). This is the most common format for web design.
* **RGB**: A set of three numbers that define color based on red, green, and blue values (for example, rgb(30,144,255)). This is useful for precise control over color blending and opacity.
* **Custom Values**: Accepts dynamic tokens such as _{{ custom\_values.primary\_color }}._ These allow the color to be pulled from your custom values, making it easy to change in one place and have it update everywhere it is used.

## **Validation and Duplicate-Color Prevention**
  
  
#### **Custom Color Validation**

  
Custom token values must exist in the current location’s configuration before they can be stored, which prevents broken references.
  
  
#### **Duplicate Color Prevention**

  
Stay consistent and error-free! If you try to save a shade already in the palette, the picker flags it instantly and prompts you to adjust the value.

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

  
**Q: Will existing pages change if I edit a Brand Color?**  
No. Brand Color updates apply going forward. Colors already saved on existing elements or text stay the same.

  
**Q: Why do I see a “duplicate color” message when I try to save?**  
The value you entered already exists in the palette, or a saved custom value resolves to the same value. Change the value or edit the existing swatch instead.  
  
**Q: Can I rename or delete a custom color without breaking pages?**  
A: Yes. Renaming or deleting a swatch does not change colors that are already applied on existing pages.  
  
**Q: Can I bulk-import brand colors?**  
A: Add them in the Brand Board; they automatically appear at the top of the palette.

  
**Q: Why won’t my custom value color save?**  
The token must exist in your current location’s Custom Values and the final value cannot duplicate an existing swatch. Check that the custom value exists in your account.
