# **What is Audit Logging?**

  
Audit Logging captures a history of user actions within your HighLevel assets. This gives you a full trail of changes—who did what, when, and where—making it easier to troubleshoot, improve workflows, and maintain compliance.

  
## **Key Benefits of Audit Logging**

  
Audit logs help teams stay accountable, resolve issues faster, and manage digital assets more effectively by offering a clear historical record of changes.

* Get full transparency into edits and deletions
* Improve team accountability by tracking who made changes
* Troubleshoot errors by reviewing specific action history
* Ensure compliance for regulated industries
* Isolate issues using filters by module or action type
* Retain logs securely for 60 days

##   

## **How to Access Audit Logs**

  
Audit Logs are located in the Settings area of your account and are organized by module. Each module has its own audit trail and filtering system, allowing you to track actions independently across Funnels, Websites, Webinars, and Stores.

  
To access Audit Logs:

1. Navigate to **Settings > Audit Logs** from your left-hand menu.
2. Use the tabbed navigation or icons to switch between modules:  
   * Funnels  
   * Websites  
   * Webinars  
   * Stores (eCommerce)
3. Review the logs listed for the selected module.

  
## **Audit Log Coverage by Module**

  
Each module maintains its own set of logs and filters, so you can focus on the specific type of asset you’re working with.

* **Funnels:** Logs funnel settings changes, step edits, split tests, and deletions.
* **Websites:** Tracks updates to pages, structures, and content.
* **Webinars:** Captures scheduling, edits, and webinar configuration updates.
* **Stores:** Records eCommerce changes like store configuration and product management.

  
This modular approach ensures the audit data remains relevant and easy to interpret for each asset type.

##   

## **Tracked Actions and Event Types**

  
HighLevel currently tracks the following types of actions across supported modules:

* Folder Delete
* Move to Folder
* Funnel Delete
* Funnel Settings Change
* Funnel Settings Change (with domain removed)
* Step Edit
* Step Reorder
* Step Delete
* Step Restore Variation
* Step Delete Variation
* Step Choose Split Test Winner
* Stats Reset
* Page Edit

  
These logs include timestamps, user IDs, and action types to help you reconstruct exactly what happened and when.

  
## **Filtering and Navigation Tips**

  
Audit Logs include filters that make it easy to locate specific events or actions. Each module has independent filtering options.

  
You can filter logs by:

* **Module** – Funnels, Websites, Webinars, or Stores
* **Action Type** – e.g., Deleted, Updated, Created
* **Date/Time Range** – View actions within a specific period (limited to the last 60 days)

  
Tips for navigation:

* Use action filters to locate deletions, edits, or structural changes
* Use date ranges to isolate events related to a campaign launch
* Quickly switch between modules using the tabs/icons at the top of the interface

  
## **Data Retention Policy**

  
Audit Logs are retained for a **rolling 60-day period**. After that, records are permanently deleted and cannot be recovered.

  
Important:

* Logs older than 60 days are **not retrievable**
* Consider exporting or recording key actions for long-term compliance needs
* Set internal review processes to capture logs before they expire
