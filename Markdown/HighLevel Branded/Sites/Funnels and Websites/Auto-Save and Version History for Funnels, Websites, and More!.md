We've introduced **Auto-Save** and an improved **Version History** feature to make the editing experience more reliable and user-friendly across Funnels, Websites, Blogs, Webinars, and E-Commerce. This ensures your changes are saved automatically and that you can easily access previous versions when needed.

## How Auto-Save Works

* **Real-Time Auto-Save**  
As you make changes, they are automatically saved in real time. There's no need to click “Save” manually.
* **Visual Indicators**  
You’ll see indicators such as “Saving…” and “Auto Saved” to confirm that your progress is being saved.
* **Manual Save Still Available**  
If you prefer to save manually, the “Save” button remains available for full control.

## Version History Overview

Version History allows you to review and restore previous versions of your content. This is useful for undoing changes, reverting to earlier designs, or tracking progress.

### Key Details

* **Time-Stamped Versions**  
Each version is labeled with the date and time it was saved for easy reference.
* **Auto-Save Timing**  
A new version is saved every 10 minutes, but only if changes were made during that time.
* **Version Limit**  
Up to 50 versions (auto and manual combined) are stored for each item. The oldest versions are removed once this limit is reached.
* **Global Section Alert**  
When editing a Global Section, a popup will appear to inform you that the changes will apply across all instances where that section is used.
