# **What is an Exit Intent Pop-up?**

  
Exit intent pop-ups are triggered when a user's cursor behavior indicates they are about to leave your site, typically by moving toward the browser bar or close button. HighLevel enables you to design pop-ups within the website or funnel builder and configure them to trigger based on exit intent.

## **Key Benefits of Exit Intent Pop-ups**

  
Exit-intent pop-ups can significantly boost lead capture and conversion by offering a last-chance call-to-action. Here's what makes them valuable:

  
* **Reduce bounce rate:** Prevent users from leaving without engaging by presenting an offer right before they exit.
* **Capture abandoning visitors:** Use one final message or incentive to collect lead information before the user leaves.
* **Boost conversion rates:** Exit pop-ups can turn hesitant users into leads with time-limited deals or special discounts.
* **Customizable content:** Design the look, layout, and form fields of your pop-up to fit your brand.
* **Flexible form integration:** Embed any HighLevel form to collect emails, phone numbers, or other key data.
* **Works within funnel and website builder:** No need for third-party tools—exit-intent behavior is built into HighLevel’s editor.

## **How To Create an Exit Intent Pop-up**

  
Follow these steps to build your exit-intent pop-up from form creation to trigger configuration.

###   

#### **Step 1:** Create a Form for Your Pop-up

  
Forms are what allow you to collect information from users in the pop-up. Start by creating or locating the form you want to use in the pop-up.

To make the pop-up appear when users attempt to leave, you need to configure the correct setting.

  
* Click the blue button named **Pop Up Settings** with the **gear icon** at the top of the pop-up.
* In the sidebar, scroll to **"Show Pop-up On".**

## **Desktop vs Mobile Behavior**

  
Exit intent detection uses mouse cursor tracking, so it only works on desktop. This behavior does not function on mobile because touchscreens lack a cursor.

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

  
**Q: Can I use an exit-intent pop-up on a non-HighLevel website?**  
No. Exit-intent pop-ups are only supported on funnels and websites built inside HighLevel.  
  
**Q: What happens if I choose "None" or "Delay" instead of "Exit"?**  
The pop-up won't behave as an exit-intent prompt. "None" disables it, and "Delay" will show the pop-up after a time delay instead of cursor exit.  
  
**Q: Can I use different forms for different pop-ups?**  
Yes. You can assign different forms to individual pop-ups on each funnel step or page.  
  
**Q: Can I preview the pop-up before going live?**  
Yes. Use the page preview option inside the builder to test behavior before publishing.  
  
**Q: Does the pop-up styling match my site?**  
You can fully customize the pop-up's row, column, background, and form styles to match your site branding.
