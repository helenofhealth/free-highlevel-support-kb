## **Frequently Asked Questions**

  
**Q: What if the heading dropdown isn’t visible?**  
Ensure the text that you are editing is a heading and not plain text. The dropdown will only show for headings.  
  
**Q: Can I use multiple H1 tags?**  
It’s possible, but not recommended. One H1 per page provides clarity and better SEO.

  
**Q: Does changing a heading tag change how it looks?**  
Not always. Heading styles can be customized using CSS. It’s the tag itself (H1–H6) that affects SEO and structure. Even if two headings look visually identical, using different tags (H1 vs. H2) helps search engines and screen readers understand the hierarchy of your content.

**Q: Are heading tags mobile-responsive?**  
Yes. You can preview and style headings per device in the website builder.
