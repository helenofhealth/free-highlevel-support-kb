**Tracking code does not get copied when you copy a step in a funnel or when you copy a page of a website, why?**

  
**Parent Page:**

**Cloned Page:**

**Reason:**

Tracking code is specific to a certain page right, users may complain of some side effects related to multiple tracking or events from the wrong page, then come to know that there’s tracking code from older funnel.

Plus people also share their funnels across locations/agencies, i don’t think they would like that tracking code is being shared as well.
