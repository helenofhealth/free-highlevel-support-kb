## **Hiding Elements**

Add an interactive layer to designs by hiding elements when a button is clicked.

2\. On the right side of the screen, you'll find the element settings. Under **_General_**, scroll all the way down to "**_Button Actions_**".

## **Showing Elements**

**Similarly, you can reveal hidden elements when a button is clicked.**
  
  
1\. Select an element you want to "Show" from a "Hidden" state and go to **_Advanced Settings_**. For this example, we will be using a Form to be revealed when a button is clicked.

**Helpful Tip**: 

Name your element/s with an identifying label so it's easier to find them from the list.
  
  
6\. Once you have chosen which element/s to show when the button is clicked, click the **_Save_** button, and preview your funnel or website to test.

## **Editing Hidden Elements**

  
If you've accidentally hidden an element from both desktop and mobile views, you won’t be able to see or click it on the canvas—but you can still access and edit it using the Layers panel in the builder.

  
1. **Open the Layers Panel**  
    
In the top left of the Funnel or Website Builder, click the **Layers** icon (stacked layers). This will open a list of all the elements in your section/page, including hidden ones.
2. **Find the Hidden Element**  
    
Scroll through the list to locate the element you hid. It may appear dimmed or with an "eye" icon indicating it’s not visible on either view.
3. **Select the Element**  
    
Click the element's name in the list to select it. The element will now be highlighted in the builder, and its settings panel will appear.
4. **Restore Visibility**  
    
With the element selected, click the **visibility toggle (eye icon)** in the top bar to turn it back on for desktop and/or mobile.
