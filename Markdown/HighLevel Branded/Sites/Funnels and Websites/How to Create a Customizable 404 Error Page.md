# **What is the Customizable 404 Error Page?**

  
A customizable 404 error page is a feature that allows you to replace the default "Page Not Found" message with a page of your design. When users try to access a webpage on your site that is unavailable or is unavailable, they're typically shown a standard 404 error page. This page is often unhelpful and can disrupt the user's experience, sometimes even prompting them to leave your site.

  
However, with a customizable 404 error page, you can turn an unfortunate situation into a positive one. You can design this page to align with your brand's image and messaging. This can include elements like your company's logo, colors, fonts, and other visuals that fit your brand.

  
But it's not just about the look. An effective custom 404 page will also offer helpful information and options to the user. This can include explaining why they're seeing the error page, which can be done in a friendly and approachable way.  
  
Another great strategy is to include links to other parts of your site, such as the homepage, popular products or posts, or your contact page. This provides a next step for the user and encourages them to stay on your site and continue exploring rather than leaving due to the error.

## **What are some good usage cases for this feature?**

  
404 errors, also known as "Page Not Found" errors, typically occur when a user tries to access a webpage that doesn't exist on the server. This can happen due to several reasons:

  
**Broken or Dead Links:** This is one of the most common causes of 404 errors. If there are old links on your website, or if other websites are linking to pages that no longer exist, users who click these links will be greeted with a 404 error.

  
Usage Case: Suppose you have a blog, and you are linked to a specific article in one of your posts. If that article gets deleted or moved to a different URL, anyone who clicks on the original link will see a 404 error. A custom 404 page could display a message like "Sorry, the article you're looking for is no longer here. But feel free to explore our recent posts!" and include links to other blog posts or the blog homepage.

  
**URL Change Without Redirection:** If you change the URL of a page without setting up a proper redirect, users who try to access the old URL will encounter a 404 error.

  
Usage Case: Let's say you run an e-commerce store, and you've recently updated your product URLs for SEO reasons. If a customer has bookmarked an old product URL, they'll encounter a 404 error when they try to access it. Your custom 404 page could say, "Oops, looks like the product you're looking for has moved. But don't worry, you can search for it here!" and include a search bar or links to product categories.

  
**User Typing Error:** Sometimes, users may manually type a URL into the address bar and make a mistake, causing a 404 error.

  
Usage Case: A user tries to access a particular page on your site, but they make a typo when entering the URL. Your custom 404 page could include a friendly message like "Oops, we couldn't find the page you're looking for. Try checking the URL, or explore our site using the links below." You could provide links to your site's homepage, popular pages, or a map.

  
**Deleted Pages:** If you delete a page on your website, any users trying to access that page will see a 404 error.

  
Usage Case: You run a news website and recently deleted some old articles. If a user tries to access one of these articles, they'll see a 404 error. Your custom 404 page could say, "Looks like the story you're looking for isn't here anymore. But there's always fresh news to discover!" and include links to the latest articles or news categories.

  
These are some specific events leading to 404 errors and how a custom 404 page can turn these errors into more positive user experiences.

## **Benefits of customizable 404 error page**

  
The customizable 404 error page feature offers several significant benefits:

  
**Improved User Experience:** A well-designed 404 page can help to mitigate the frustration of reaching an error page. It can provide helpful information, options to navigate elsewhere on your site, or even a touch of humor to lighten the moment.

  
**Brand Consistency:** A custom 404 page allows you to maintain brand consistency even in error situations. This can reinforce your brand identity and show professionalism.

  
**Reduced Bounce Rate:** By providing helpful links and options on your 404 page, you can encourage users to stay on your site and continue browsing rather than leaving due to the error. This can help to reduce your site's bounce rate.

  
**Opportunity for Engagement:** A 404 page can be a chance to engage users in unexpected ways. Some websites use their 404 pages to showcase creativity, share interesting facts or offers, or prompt users to interact with other elements on the site.

  
**SEO Benefits:** While 404 errors don't directly harm your site's SEO, they can lead to a poor user experience that indirectly impacts SEO. By guiding users back to active parts of your site, custom 404 pages can help to maintain your site's SEO performance.

  
**Guidance:** A custom 404 page can guide visitors back to a working page on your site, keeping them engaged rather than feeling lost or frustrated.

  
A customizable 404 error page is a minor feature that can make a big difference in how users perceive and interact with your site, particularly when encountering an error.

### **Create a page to use as your domain's 404 error page:**

  
You will first need to create a page on your Funnel or Website Builder, which you can use as the 404 Error Page.

Note: Try to have a unique 404/Error page for every domain.
  
  
### **Choosing the domain's default 404 page:**

  
* Navigate to **Settings> Domains.** Click **Manage** next to domain you would like to edit the default 404 page on.

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

  
**Q: Can I track the performance of my custom 404 error page?**

Yes, you can use tools like Google Analytics to track the performance of your custom 404 error page. This can help you understand how often users reach this page and what they do after seeing it.

**Q: Is having more than one custom 404 error page possible within one Funnel/Website?**

While technically possible, by using different Domains and Subdomains for different steps within one site and then having different 404 pages for each domain and subdomain, It's usually best to have one consistent 404 page across your site for brand consistency and user experience. However, if your site has distinctly different sections (e.g., a blog and an e-commerce store), creating 404 pages for each section might make sense.

**Q: Does having a custom 404 error page affect my site's SEO?**

While 404 errors don't directly impact your site's SEO, a custom 404 page can help maintain a positive user experience, which is an indirect factor in SEO. It can also guide users back to active pages on your site, which can help to maintain your site's overall traffic and engagement levels.

  
**Q: I've created a custom 404 page, but users still see the default error page. What could be the problem?**

This could be due to various issues, such as a problem with your server configuration or a mistake in setting up the custom 404 page. It's best to troubleshoot this issue with our Support team or your hosting provider. 

**Q: Can I use multimedia elements (like video or audio) on my custom 404 error page?**

Yes, you can include any elements on your 404 page that you would on any other site page. However, keep in mind that it's essential to maintain a balance between creativity and usability. Any elements you add should enhance the user's experience and not confuse or frustrate them.

  
**Q: How often should I update my custom 404 error page?**

There's no hard-and-fast rule for how often to update your 404 page, but it's a good idea to review it regularly to ensure it remains effective and aligns with any changes to your brand or website. If you add new features or significant sections to your site, consider updating your 404 page to include references or links to these additions.
