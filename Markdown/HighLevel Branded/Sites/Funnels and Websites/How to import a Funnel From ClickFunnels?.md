The ClickFunnels to GoHighLevel importer is useful for individuals or businesses looking to switch from ClickFunnels to GoHighLevel and want to migrate their existing funnels and pages without rebuilding them from scratch. It could save significant time and effort, particularly for those with many funnels or pages to transfer.  
  
**Please Note:**

- This imported will work for both **ClickFunnels 1.0 & ClickFunnels 2.0 Funnels.**  
  
- Please ensure that you utilize the publishable (live) link, and **not** the shareable click funnel link. It's essential to import one Funnel Step at a time from ClickFunnels for a seamless experience.![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/48291012563/original/DCAJE_REAKL-wXJevJXVYo1Gr2w8a5m-Jg.png?1680615158)

The HighLevel importer only transfers standard funnel pages (opt-ins, sales, thank-you, etc.) If your ClickFunnels funnel includes a Members Area, you'll need to rebuild it manually using HighLevel’s **Memberships tool**, which you can find in the main left-side navigation bar named **Memberships.**
