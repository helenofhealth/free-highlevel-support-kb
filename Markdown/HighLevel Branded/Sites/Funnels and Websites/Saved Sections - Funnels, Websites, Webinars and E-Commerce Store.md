## **What are Saved Section Templates?**

  
Saved Section Templates are a powerful enhancement in HighLevel that allow users to create, save, and reuse content sections across multiple assets, such as Funnels, Websites, Webinars, and E-Commerce Stores. With this update, you can choose between three types of saved sections: Universal (syncs everywhere), Global (syncs within a single asset), and Template (static, reusable, and non-syncing). 

  
* **Section Templates:** Saves as a copy, which can be used anywhere as a template.
* **Global Sections:** Saves at the funnel level. Any changes in one instance will sync across this funnel only.
* **Universal Sections:** Saves at the account level. Any changes in one instance will sync across all instances, account-wide.

  
This system ensures design consistency, saves time, and reduces confusion about how content updates propagate.

  
**Difference between Universal and Global Sections:**   
  
**Universal Sections** update automatically across every instance in the account across Funnels, Websites, Webinars, and E-Commerce Store.  
  
**Global Sections** update only within the current funnel/website.

## **Key Benefits of Saved Section Templates**

  
Saved Section Templates offer several advantages that help users manage content more efficiently and maintain brand consistency:

* **Centralized Updates:** Universal Sections automatically sync changes across all instances in Funnels, Websites, Webinars, and E-Commerce Stores.
* **Flexible Reuse:** Choose between Universal, Global, or Template sections based on your needs for syncing or static content.
* **Visual Selection:** Automated screenshots and clear labels make it easy to preview and select saved sections.
* **Efficient Cloning:** Cloned sections and snapshots get unique IDs, so edits to copies won’t affect originals.
* **Improved Performance:** Enhanced backend architecture ensures faster syncing, better reliability, and secure template management.
* **Reduced Confusion:** Clear section types and visual cues help users understand how edits will impact their content.
* **No Personal Data Stored:** Only layout information is saved, protecting user privacy.

* **Global:** Syncs updates only within the current funnel or website.
* **Template:** Creates a static, reusable section that does not sync when edited elsewhere.

## **Best Practices for Section Management**

  
* Plan your section type before saving, as it cannot be changed later.
* Use Universal Sections for content that must stay consistent everywhere (e.g., headers, footers).
* Use Global Sections for content unique to a specific funnel or website.
* Use Templates for reusable blocks that may need customization in each instance.
* To change a section’s type, clone it and save the clone under the desired type.

**Q: Can I change the type of a section after saving it?**

No, once a section is saved as Universal, Global, or Template, its type cannot be changed. Clone the section and save the clone under a different type if needed.

**Q: Will edits to a Universal Section update everywhere?**

Yes, any changes made to a Universal Section will automatically sync across all instances in Funnels, Websites, Webinars, Blogs, and E-Commerce Stores.

**Q: What happens if I clone a funnel or section?**

Cloned sections receive a unique ID and do not sync with the original, allowing you to edit them independently.
