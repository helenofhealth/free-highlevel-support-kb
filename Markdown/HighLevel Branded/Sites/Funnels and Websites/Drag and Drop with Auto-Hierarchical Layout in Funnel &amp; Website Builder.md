## **What is Enhanced Drag and Drop with Auto-Hierarchical Layout?**

  
Enhanced drag-and-drop functionality in the builder allows users to add elements to the canvas without needing to manually configure layout structures in advance. Now you can drop any element directly onto the canvas without worrying about setting up the correct structure first. The builder automatically creates the right layout hierarchy behind the scenes. This means fewer clicks, less confusion, and much faster page and funnel building.
