## **How Authorization Works**

  
* This is **not** turned on by default and will require a couple of quick extra steps, covered below
* The system will remove the monetary value placed in the "authorized amount" from the client's bank account before crediting it back later.
* If the account does not have the funds during the authorization process, they will not be allowed to continue to the next step.
* Upon authorization approval, the system will credit back the account for the amount used to authorize.
* If you have any "**Trial days**" attached to the plan, those will kick in as soon as the card is authorized.
* Funds may take up to 5 business days before being returned to the client's bank account
* It **ONLY** works with Subscriptions and Payment plans.

**Please Note:** 

If you would like to authorize payment before purchase for all your plans, this process will need to be repeated for each plan attached to the payment form.

## **Setting up Authorization**

  
**1\. Head into the website and find the step where the order form is placed**

Click on the **"3 dots"**
  
  
![Click on highlight](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/48170358032/original/WWIbWCnmtTu8hy8qQMQD8w8zCCmfx5OLpQ.png?1639434227)
  
  
**2\. Click on "Products"**

If you do not see any products attached to your page, you will need to add them before continuing.

**3\. Click on the "Edit" icon**

This will open the product settings. In this example, there are two plans (monthly $149 & Annual $1490) where "Authorization" will need to be turned on.

  
First, we will start with plan 1 (monthly $149), then return and repeat this process for plan 2 (Annual plan $1490).

**5\. Click on "Custom Authorization" and add your amount**

  
**Please Note:**

Keep in mind the amount you place here will be deducted from the clients account.  
  
If the funds are unavailable they will not be able to proceed. In this example: The system will take "$1" out of the clients account and then refund the "$1" back.  
  
The refund process may take up to 5 business days before returning the amount taken. ONLY works with Subscriptions and Payment plans.  
  
**The number should be:** 
equal to or more than 1,   
number of decimals should be just two.   
Should NOT be a negative number
