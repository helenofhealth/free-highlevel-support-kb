### Scanning Your Website for Cookies

2. Use a free tool like [CookieServe](https://www.cookieserve.com/) to scan your website.
3. Review the detected cookies and assign them to the correct categories.

Important: Disable the banner before scanning, as it blocks non-essential cookies, preventing a complete scan.
