## **What is a 301 Redirect?**

  
A **301 redirect** is a permanent redirection from one URL to another. It helps ensure that users and search engines are directed to the correct webpage when URLs change.

---

## **Why Use 301 Redirects?**

  
* **Preserve SEO rankings** – Prevents broken links and retains search engine authority.
* **Enhance user experience** – Redirects visitors seamlessly to the right page.
* **Consolidate domains** – Redirect multiple domain versions (e.g., `www.yoursite.com` to `yoursite.com`).
* **Fix outdated links** – Ensure old URLs still lead to relevant pages.

## **How to Set Up 301 Redirects in HighLevel**

  
Follow these steps to configure 301 redirects for your domains:

  
### **Step 1:** Navigate to URL Redirects

  
URL Redirects can be found under Subaccount/Location Settings.

###   

### **Step 2:** Choose the Redirect Type

  
HighLevel offers four types of redirects:

  
#### **1\. Redirect to Another URL**

* Use this to send visitors from one specific URL to another.
* Ensure the domain is added to your HighLevel sub-account.
* Format:  
   * **Path**: Include `/` followed by the page name (e.g., `/old-page`).  
   * **Target URL**: Enter the full URL where visitors should be redirected.

The domain you are redirecting from must already be added to your HighLevel sub-account.

  
####   

#### **2\. Redirect to a Funnel Step**  
  
* Redirects traffic to a specific funnel step in HighLevel.
* The funnel must be associated with a domain in your sub-account.

####   

#### **3\. Redirect to a Website Page**

  
* Redirects traffic to a specific page on your HighLevel website.
* Ensure the website is linked to a domain in your sub-account.

####   

  
#### **4\. Redirect All Paths (REGEX Redirects)**

  
* Redirect all paths from one domain to another.

### **Step 3:** Save and Test Your Redirects

  
1. Click **Save** after setting up your redirect.
2. Open a browser and enter the original URL to ensure it redirects correctly.
3. Use online redirect checker tools for verification.

## **Best Practices for 301 Redirects**

  
* **Use absolute URLs** (e.g., `https://newsite.com/page`) to prevent errors.
* **Avoid redirect chains** – Directly redirect old URLs to the final destination.
* **Check for broken redirects** regularly to ensure they work properly.
* **Use REGEX carefully** – Misuse can lead to incorrect redirects.

## **Common Issues & Troubleshooting**

  
❌ **Redirect loop** – Ensure you’re not redirecting a URL to itself.  
  
❌ **404 Errors** – Double-check that the target page exists.   
  
❌ **Slow load times** – Too many redirects can impact performance.
