## **How to prepare your video to allow Progress tracking via Workflow?**

1\. A video needs to be encoded for it to [show up in the filters](https://www.loom.com/share/a8bf99ab64e64a7ca11814dd81e56e5f?t=58) for a Video Tracking Workflow Trigger.  
2\. We recommend turning off [Show Progress Bar ](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/48001224428-hosted-video-player-for-funnels#:~:text=Full%20Screen%20Toggle%3A-,Show%20Progress%20Bar%3A,-Redirect%20Unregistered%20Visitors)in the Video Element settings so viewers cannot move back and forwards in a video, to assure accurate progress tracking.
