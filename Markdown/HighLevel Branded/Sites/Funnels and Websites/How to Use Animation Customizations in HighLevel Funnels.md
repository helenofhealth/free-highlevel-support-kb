# **What is Animation Customizations in Funnels & Websites?**

  
**Animation Customizations** is a built-in feature in the Page Builder that allows you to control how individual elements animate across your funnels and websites. It provides a dedicated adjustment panel where you can apply and fine-tune animation effects such as scale, duration, delay, and easing—all with real-time preview. The panel organizes these controls into clearly labeled sections, making it easy to adjust how elements enter, exit, or move on the page without leaving the editor or using custom code.

  
You can modify animations with precision:

  
* **Scale**: from 0.5× to 2× for subtle to dramatic effects
* **Duration**: from 0.1 to 3 seconds to set pacing
* **Delay**: up to 5 seconds for staggered sequences
* **Easing**: choose from Linear, Ease-In, Ease-Out, and Ease-In-Out for smooth transitions

  
These settings give you complete control over visual motion, helping you create more personalized, engaging page designs.

## **Key Benefits of Animation Customizations**

  
Animation Customizations enhance both your design workflow and the user experience on your pages. Here’s what you can expect:

  
* **Granular control**: Tailor how each animation behaves by adjusting scale, duration, delay, and easing with exact values.
* **Real-time preview**: See your adjustments immediately, so you can fine-tune motion without guesswork.
* **Organized layout**: All controls are housed in a clean, intuitive panel that streamlines the editing process.
* **Professional polish**: By customizing how elements animate, you can guide user attention, reinforce branding, and build more dynamic interactions—without relying on third-party tools.

  
Together, these capabilities give you the tools to craft smooth, high-impact animations directly inside the HighLevel Page Builder.
