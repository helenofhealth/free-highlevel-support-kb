* [Steps to fix existing funnel in WordPress:](#Steps-to-fix-existing-funnel-in-WordPress%3A)

###   

### Scenario 1

* If client faced this issue only on some of the customer's browser. It means due to some customer browser settings, we are not able to access cookies (storage).**Solution:** This is very rare chances of this issue. So for a quick fix, guide customer to update browser settings & enable cookies access. For a long term fix, we will add warning from our side if we won't able to access cookies

  
### Scenario 2

* If client faced this issue every time on every devices & browsers, it means funnel domain is not configured properly.**Solution:** If website is hosted on WordPress & they are using our order form funnel inside that as separate path, then WordPress website domain & funnel domain should be same but subdomain should be different. Suppose your WordPress website configured with www.example.com , example.com is your domain & www is subdomain. So now you should not use www.example.com or example.com as funnel domain. Use different subdomain (e.g. funnels.example.com ) in funnel.

  
* **Why need same domain?**

 As per our current implementation, we are using iFrame to render funnel page inside WordPress. For payment, we need web browser cookies (storage) access & web browser doesn't allow access over cross domain.

  
### Steps to add domain in Funnel:

  
1\. Go to Settings -> Domains and add the same domain (as WordPress website) with different subdomain. (Make sure there should have not be hosted any other website on that subdomain)
