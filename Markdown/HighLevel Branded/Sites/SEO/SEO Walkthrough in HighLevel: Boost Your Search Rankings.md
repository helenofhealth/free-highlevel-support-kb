Quota is consumed every time Search Atlas runs, refreshes, or prefetches a scan. For circle maps, more layers mean more quota: for example, 1 layer uses 7 points, 2 layers 20, 3 layers 39, and so on up to 7 layers at 175\. Rectangular grids use quota based on size, such as 3x3 needing 9 points, 4x4 needing 16, up to 7x7 at 49 points. For example, choosing a circle with 3 layers (61 pins) and scanning weekly would use about 244 credits per month. | More > Local SEO > Local SEO Heatmap                                 | Yes                |

## 5\. Step-by-Step Guide to Getting Started

1. To get started, log in to your GoHighLevel account and navigate to Sites > SEO in the sidebar. If SEO is not enabled for your sub-account, your agency may need to activate it
2. Main SEO Dashboard Tabs: You’ll notice three primary tabs in the SEO section – Site Projects,
3. Local SEO, and Settings. Each serves a different purpose:  
   * Site Projects: For monitoring websites (domains) – shows overall site metrics, health, backlinks, traffic, etc.  
   * Local SEO: For tracking Google Maps rankings of local businesses – uses interactive heatmaps for local keyword positions.  
   * Settings: For checking your quota usage.
4. **Launch Advanced SEO**: Within the SEO dashboard, you will see a button labeled “Launch Advanced SEO”. Clicking this opens the full suite of SEO tools in a new window with an expanded toolkit for in-depth analysis, content creation, and reports.
