For businesses that rely on local customers - think brick-and-mortar stores or service providers in specific cities – ranking in Google’s local results is critical. GoHighLevel’s Local SEO feature helps you visualize and track how a business performs across different areas using Local SEO Heatmaps. In this article, we’ll explain how to set up a local SEO project, use the heatmap tool to see local rankings, interpret the metrics like Average Rank, and manage your credits (points) for local tracking. We’ll also cover local SEO best practices and troubleshooting tips.

## **What is the Local SEO Heatmap?**

The Local SEO Heatmap is an interactive grid or map that shows where your business appears in Google’s local results for a given keyword across a geographic area. Essentially, it answers: “If someone searches for \[keyword\] near Location X, where does my business rank on the map?” It’s incredibly useful for local SEO because rankings can vary even across a town or city.

**Key elements of the heatmap tool:**

* **Pins/Grid:** The map will display a set of points (pins) laid out either in a grid (e.g., 7x7 grid) or concentric circles around a center point (your business location).
* **Rank Numbers:** Each pin is color-coded and labeled with a number 1–20 (or 21+). This is the position your business ranks in the local results at that location.
* **Average Rank:** The tool will calculate an overall Average Rank score for your business across all the pins for that keyword.
* **Competitor Comparison:** Optionally, you can overlay a competitor’s presence on the map to see how you stack up in different areas.
* **Keywords:** You can track multiple keywords per business in separate heatmaps.

On the GHL Local SEO tab, after adding a local project, you’ll see each business listed with columns like Business Name, Average Rank, # of Keywords, and perhaps Google Rating (stars from GBP).

## **Setting Up a Local SEO Project**

1. **Connect Google Business Profile:**  
Before adding a local project, ensure you have connected your Google account under SEO Settings and granted access to your Google Business Profile (GBP).
2. **Add New Local Business:**  
In Sites > SEO > Local SEO, click “Create New” (or “New Business” button). Select your business from the list (or search for it exactly as it’s named on Google).
3. **Configure Project:**  
Give the project a name if needed. Once added, GHL will display the business in the Local SEO table.
4. **Open Heatmap View:**  
Click “View” or the business name to open the Local SEO Heatmap. You’ll see your business’s location on a map and options to add keywords and adjust settings.

## **Credit Usage for Local SEO (Heatmap Points)**

* **1,000 points/month**.
* **Each pin = 1 point per scan.**
* **Each keyword tracked = separate heatmap and points.**
* **Scanning on both Desktop and Mobile = 2x points.**

**Example:**

* 7x7 grid (49 pins) scanned weekly for 1 keyword = 196 points/month.
* Tracking 3 keywords like this = 588 points/month.

**Tips to Optimize Usage:**

* Reduce grid size (e.g., 5x5 or 4x4).
* Lower scan frequency (bi-weekly or monthly).
* Track a single platform (Desktop or Mobile).
* Prioritize 1–5 most valuable keywords.

## **Improving and Using Heatmap Insights**

* **Geo-Targeted SEO:** Create content/landing pages for low-ranking regions.
* **GBP Optimization:** Ensure category, reviews, and contact info are complete and consistent.
* **Competitor Analysis:** Identify and research who ranks better in specific areas.
* **Track Progress:** Re-scan after SEO improvements.
* **Reporting:** Export or share heatmaps for client presentations.

* **Combine with Organic SEO:** Site Projects and Content tools can help.
* **Avoid Wasting Points:** Don’t overtrack keywords where you're not ranking yet.
