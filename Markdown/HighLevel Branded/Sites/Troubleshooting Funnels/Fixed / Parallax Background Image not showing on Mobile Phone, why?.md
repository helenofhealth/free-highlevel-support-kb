Parallax images or also known as Fixed background images do not properly work on iPhones and iPad. This is a limitation by iOS which blocks the Javascript for this animation. This works perfectly on Android phones or tablet, chrome book and Windows tablets.

iOs mobile Safari has a problem rendering fixed background images, unfortunately. This is an iOS browser limitation.

This issue is faced by many other platforms and every platform has its own workaround for this issue.
