# **What is WordPress Site Cloning?**

  
WordPress site cloning is the process of duplicating an existing site to create a new, fully independent copy. This functionality preserves the source site's configurations, themes, plugins, and content. Cloning is especially useful for creating multiple sites with similar layouts, designs, or settings.

# **Why Clone a WordPress Site?**

  
* **Efficiency**: Save time by reusing an existing site's setup instead of building from scratch.
* **Consistency**: Ensure uniformity in themes, plugins, and settings across multiple sites.
* **Flexibility**: Create independent sites where changes to one do not affect others.
* **Ease of Use**: Simplifies complex workflows, such as testing updates or creating development environments.

# **Role-Based Access for Cloning**

Access to the cloning feature is governed by user roles to ensure security. Only users with the following roles can clone WordPress sites:  
  
* **Agency Owners**
* **Agency Users**
* **Account Users** (within the same sub-account)

If a user lacks the necessary permissions, they will only be able to create a new site from scratch. This ensures that only authorized individuals can duplicate sites.
