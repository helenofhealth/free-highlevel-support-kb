Some domain providers take 24 - 48 hours to propagate DNS changes while others are instant. You can use tools like <https://dnschecker.org/> to check if your DNS changes are propagated or not.

### Domain Not Adding Troubleshooting

  
This can happen due to a few reasons

1. There is a typo in your domain name \[_like in the example above_\]  
In this scenario fixing the typo will resolve your issue
2. Your DNS changes haven't propagated yet  
In this case you need to wait longer and try again after a few hours or the next day to see if it works
3. Your DNS configuration is not setup correctly  
Please reach out to your Domain Provider and discuss the errors with their support team
4. Maybe you have conflicting records for the same subdomain \[_for example if [blog.mydomain.com](//blog.mydomain.com) has a CNAME record pointing to [wp1.msgsndr.com](https://wp1.msgsndr.com) but it also has an A record pointing to some other provider_\]  
In such cases removing the other duplicate record will fix your issue

In most cases with your DNS setup, HighLevel support teams will not be able to assist you and you may need to reach out to your domain provider.
