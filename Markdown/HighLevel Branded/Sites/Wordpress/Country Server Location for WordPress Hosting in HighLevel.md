# **What is Country Server Selection For WordPress Hosting?**

  
Country Server Selection is a WordPress hosting feature in HighLevel that integrates right into your dashboard, letting you choose exactly which data center (Ashburn, Phoenix, London, etc.) will host your site’s files before the server spins up. This ensures visitors always load pages from the closest server for optimal performance, and once you pick a region during setup, it’s permanently embedded in your site’s metadata and visible on your site card.

## **Understanding Immutable Locations** 

  
Because your files and database reside on physical hardware, the chosen region is locked the moment the server spins up.  
  
* If you need a different region later, clone the site to a new location and repoint your DNS.
* Deleting and recreating the site also works but results in data loss.

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

**Q: Can I modify the server location after my site has been created?**

No, the server location selection is permanent once the site setup is complete.

  
**Q: Does the Country Server Selection feature work with all WordPress site setup methods?**

Yes, it is available for blank setups, cloning from an existing site, and template-based setups.

  
**Q: How do I determine the best server location for my site?**

Consider the geographic location of your target audience and select the nearest data center to minimize latency.

  
**Q: Will selecting a specific server location guarantee better site performance?**

While selecting a nearby data center can reduce latency and enhance performance, overall speed may also be influenced by other factors.

  
**Q. Does the region I pick affect my hosting bill?**

No. Pricing is identical across all data centers.

  
**Q. What happens if I choose the wrong location by mistake?**

Delete and recreate the site, or clone it to the correct region and migrate content.

  
**Q. Do I still need a CDN?**

A CDN is optional but recommended for global audiences. Regional hosting delivers fast origin responses; a CDN adds edge caching worldwide.
