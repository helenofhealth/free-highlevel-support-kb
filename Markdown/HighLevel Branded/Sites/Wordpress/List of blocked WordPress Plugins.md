Our constant endeavour is to optimise your WordPress sites for improved reliability, performance, and security. Unfortunately, certain plugins either attempt to replicate some of our built-in features or are not well-suited to our environment.

  
When our system administrators detect any problems associated with a plugin, we take the necessary steps to classify it as a restricted plugin. This is because such plugins could potentially lead to performance-related challenges or disrupt the smooth operation of your website.

  
Below, you'll find a compilation of WordPress plugins that are currently restricted on our platform. It's worth noting that we continuously update this list as we encounter issues with plugins, ensuring a safer and more stable environment for your website.
