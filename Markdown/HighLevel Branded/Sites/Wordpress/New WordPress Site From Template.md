# **What are Wordpress Site Templates?**

Wordpress Sites are an alternative to HighLevel Websites / Funnels. Instead of using HighLevel's built-in Site builder and host, you can hot a full Wordpress installation. This requires subscribing to HighLevel's Wordpress hosting plan, then you can use it like any other hosted Wordpress site.
