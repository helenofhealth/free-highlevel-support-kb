# Step 2: Add Form Fields (optional)

Drag and drop the required fields from the Form Elements section, for example Full Name, Email, Phone Number, Message/Custom Text Area, etc. If you need additional fields, use: Custom Fields to collect unique data. Dropdowns, checkboxes, or radio buttons for specific options. You can also rearrange fields as needed by dragging them into the desired order.

  
For the sake of this example we will use "query" as a field on the contact form.
