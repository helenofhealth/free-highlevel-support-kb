# **What is the 'Other' Option in Forms & Surveys?**

  
The “Other” option adds a write‑in field beneath any radio‑button question, empowering respondents to share an answer that isn’t listed. When enabled, their custom text is stored alongside regular choices in the form or survey submission. This feature enhances flexibility, ensuring you capture more personalized and insightful data from respondents.
