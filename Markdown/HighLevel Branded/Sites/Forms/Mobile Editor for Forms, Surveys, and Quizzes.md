## **What is the Mobile Editor?**

  
The Mobile Editor is a new feature in HighLevel that gives you dedicated tools to customize how your forms, surveys, and quizzes look on mobile devices. Instead of compromising between mobile and desktop, you can now style each experience independently — ensuring your content always looks polished and performs well across every screen size.

##   

## **Key Benefits of the Mobile Editor**

  
Delivering a smooth, mobile-first experience is key to keeping users engaged. This feature allows you to fine-tune visual elements on mobile without affecting your desktop design.

* Upload custom **header** and **background images** just for mobile
* Independently adjust **font family**, **font size**, and **font weight**
* Style specific text elements: **Labels**, **Short Labels**, **Placeholders**
* Preview and test mobile design before publishing
* Ensure forms remain user-friendly and on-brand across devices
* Increase completion rates by enhancing the mobile user experience

##   

## **How To Use the Mobile Editor**

  
Follow these steps to activate and configure your form, survey, or quiz using the Mobile Editor.

1. In **Mobile View**, the right-hand panel will now offer mobile-specific settings:  
   * **Layout Style**: Choose your preferred mobile layout.  
   * **Mobile Header Image**: Upload an image specifically for mobile headers.  
   * **Mobile Background Image**: Upload a mobile-specific background image.  
   * **Font Settings**:  
         * Adjust **Font Family**  
         * Change **Font Size**  
         * Modify **Font Weight**
2. These font settings apply individually to:  
   * **Labels** (e.g., “First Name”)  
   * **Short Labels** (e.g., field headers in condensed formats)  
   * **Placeholder Text** (e.g., “Enter your email”)  
   Once complete, **click Save**, then **Preview** to test your mobile design.

5\. When satisfied, **publish** your form — now fully mobile-optimized!

##   

## **Mobile Header & Background Images**

  
Images scale differently on mobile screens. With this feature, you can upload images specifically optimized for small devices, ensuring your design looks clean and purposeful.

  
Why this matters:

* Mobile users interact vertically — use tighter, portrait-style images.
* Prevent image cropping or distortion that often happens when desktop images scale down.

##   

## **Mobile Font Styling**

  
Text that reads well on desktop can feel cramped or oversized on a mobile screen. Use the Mobile Editor to adjust font elements individually for a smoother mobile reading experience.

  
Available Controls:

* **Font Family**: Choose from available system or custom fonts
* **Font Size**: Set exact px size for clarity on small screens
* **Font Weight**: Use bold, light, or normal to enhance visibility

  
Elements Affected:

* **Labels** — These guide users to fill fields properly
* **Short Labels** — Ideal for condensed layouts or multi-column sections
* **Placeholders** — Useful for subtle input cues
