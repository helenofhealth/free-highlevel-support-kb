## **Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)**

  
Can I assign decimal or negative scores to options?

  
Yes, you can assign both decimal and negative values to field options for more flexible scoring.

  
Do calculations work on live forms or just in preview?

  
Calculations are shown in Preview Mode during setup. For live forms, you’ll need to configure how scores are displayed or used (e.g., passed to custom fields, hidden fields, or confirmation pages).

  
Can I use conditions or logic based on the calculated score?

  
While the form builder itself supports calculations, conditional logic based on score output may require using workflows or custom automation for follow-up actions.

  
Are older forms affected by this update?

  
No. Existing forms will continue to function as before. You’ll need to manually update any forms to take advantage of the new calculation features.

  
Is this available in surveys as well as forms?

  
Yes, this update applies to both Forms and Surveys.
