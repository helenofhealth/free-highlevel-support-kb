We’ve introduced single forms and new layout options in our form builder to give you greater flexibility and control over your form designs.

What's New

Single Column Layout: This is the classic layout, where all fields are arranged vertically, one below the other.

Two Column Layout:

Previously known as inline forms, this layout allows you to place fields side-by-side in two columns, providing a balanced and compact form structure.

Single Line Layout:

Add up to 5 fields in a single horizontal line for a streamlined, minimalist form design.

Field Width:

The new Field Width in Percentage feature allows you to set the width of form fields as a percentage of the available form width. This ensures that fields scale proportionally, providing a responsive design and opening the doors for creativity

How to Use:

* Go to the form builder section in your dashboard.
* Choose your preferred layout: Single Column, Two Column, or Single Line.
* Customize your form with the new Field Width setting to control the size of each field.

Key Features / Benefits.

Three Versatile Layout Options: Choose between Single Column, Two Column, and Single Line to best suit your form’s purpose and appearance.

Single Line Layout: Perfect for creating concise, horizontal forms with up to 5 fields in one line.

Field Width Setting: Adjust the width of each field for a tailored and aesthetically pleasing form design.

Notes:

* All the old form when opened in builder. Depending upon inline form option was ON/OFF it will automatically select One Column or Two Column Layout.
* Old form in Preview will still work and it will respect the old Inline Form Settings
* Currently single line forms can have upto 5 fields.
