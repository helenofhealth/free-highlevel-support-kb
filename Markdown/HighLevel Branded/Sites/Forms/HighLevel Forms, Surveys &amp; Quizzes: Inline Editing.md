## **What is the Inline Editor?**

  
The Inline Editor is a new feature that allows you to directly click and edit text fields, labels, and options inside your form, survey, or quiz—right from the live preview. Instead of navigating to the settings panel for each element, simply click on the text you want to change, type your edits, and see updates instantly.
