We are excited to announce the Quick Add Fields & Edit Custom Fields feature in our form/survey builder. This enhancement simplifies the process of adding and managing custom fields, making it more efficient and user-friendly.
  
  
**Please Note:** When a **custom field contains the word "score"** in its name, the system **automatically interprets it as a numeric scoring element**. This happens across: **Forms,** **Surveys and** **Quizzes.** This behavior is hardcoded and tied to how we currently identify **scoring elements** in its implementations.

## **What’s New?**

  
### **Quick Add Custom Fields:** 

Previously, adding custom fields required multiple steps through the Add Custom Field modal. Now, with Quick Add, you can easily create custom fields by dragging and dropping them into the form.

### **Custom Fields which we can be draggable now:**

* Radio Select
* Single and Multi Dropdown
* Checkbox
* File upload
* Single Line
* Multi line
* Textbox List
* Date picker
* Number
* Monetary

### **Customization Options:** 

Customize options for dropdowns, radio buttons, and checkboxes, including file input options for file upload fields. You can set the custom field name and unique key.

### **Simplified Workflow:** 

Saving the form/survey will save the custom fields, making them available across all places.

### **Editing Capabilities:** 

You can edit properties of newly created or existing custom fields, such as customizing options (editing, ordering, and deleting), and file input options.  
  
To edit a custom field added to a form or survey:

* Click on the custom field within the form or survey builder.
* A navigation bar will appear on the right side.
* Use the options in the **General Settings** and **Advanced Settings** dropdowns to make the required changes.

### **Field Locking:** 

After saving the form/survey, the custom field name and unique key are locked. They can be edited from the custom fields section.

  
## **How It Works**

### **Drag and Drop:**

Drag and drop the desired field into the form.

### **Customize:** 

Customize the options for dropdowns, radio buttons, and checkboxes, or file input options for file upload fields. Set the custom field name and unique key if needed.

### **Save:** 

Save the form/survey to save the custom fields, making them available across all places.

### **Edit:** 

Edit newly created or existing custom field properties from the custom fields section and save the form/survey.

##   
**Why This Feature?**

The Quick Add Custom Fields feature is designed to save time and reduce the complexity of managing custom fields. By allowing users to add fields on-the-fly, we aim to enhance the overall user experience and improve workflow efficiency.

## **Removing Outdated or Irrelevant Custom Fields**

  
If you’re seeing outdated custom fields in your form builder—even after deleting them from the form—they may still exist in your CRM’s custom fields list.

To fully remove them:

* Navigate to **Settings > Custom Fields.**
* Locate the outdated field in the list.
* Click the **Tr** **ash** icon to permanently delete it.

  
**Warning**: Deleting a custom field from this section removes it from all forms, surveys, and contacts where it was used.

  
When a **custom field contains the word "score"** in its name, the system **automatically interprets it as a numeric scoring element**. This happens across:

* **Forms**
* **Surveys**
* **Quizzes**

This behavior is hardcoded and tied to how we currently identify **scoring elements** in its implementations.
