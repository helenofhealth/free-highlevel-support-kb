Upon clicking the "Verify Email" button, users receive a unique validation code via email. This code must be entered back into the form or survey to confirm the email address. This step ensures that the email address provided is both valid and accessible by the user, thereby enhancing data accuracy.

  
## How it works

1. **Email Entry**: Users will enter their email address in the designated field of a form or survey.
2. **Validation Prompt**: Upon entering a valid email, the "Verify Email" button will become visible next to the email input field.
3. **Send Validation Code**: Clicking this button sends a unique validation code to the user's email address.
4. **Enter Validation Code**: Users must enter this code back into the form or survey to verify their email address.
5. **Validation Confirmation**: Once the code is entered correctly, the email address is verified and marked accordingly in the submission data.
