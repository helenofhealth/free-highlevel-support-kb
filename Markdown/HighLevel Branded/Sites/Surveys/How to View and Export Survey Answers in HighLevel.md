## **Frequently Asked Questions**

  
**Q: Can I trigger automation based on survey answers?**  
Yes, use the "Survey Submitted" trigger in workflows to start automations.

  
**Q: Do survey answers show up in the CRM automatically?**  
If the survey includes fields that match contact properties (e.g., email), those fields will update the contact record.
