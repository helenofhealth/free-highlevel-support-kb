## **What’s New:**

We’re excited to introduce Payments Integration into surveys! You can now seamlessly collect payments or sell products directly from your surveys. This feature makes it easier than ever to monetize your surveys, whether you're accepting donations, selling products, or charging for services. This allows users to use surveys as 2-step-order form as well 

  
## **Key Highlights:**

* Payment Options in Surveys:  
   * Collect Payments: Accept fixed or custom payment amounts easily.  
   * Sell Products: Add products with pricing, quantity options, and even subscriptions!
* Seamless Payment Flow:  
   * Payments are processed immediately when the user moves to the next step.  
   * Partial contact will be kept on for cases where payment element is used.  
   * No additional actions required—just smooth and secure transactions.
* Informative Payment Alerts:  
   * Add an optional information box that reads:  
         * “Payment will be processed as soon as you proceed to the next step.”  
         * Fully customizable—enable or disable this alert as needed.

  
## **How It Works:**

### **Configuration:**

* Drag and drop the "Collect Payment" or "Sell Products" element into your survey.
* Add product details, pricing, and optional subscription plans in the settings.
* Customize your experience by enabling the optional payment alert.

### **Execution:**

* Users fill in their payment details, click "Next," and the payment is processed instantly.
* A confirmation screen appears for successful transactions.

### **Notes:**

* Payments are 100% secure and encrypted for safety.
* Test your setup in Test Mode to ensure a smooth experience before switching to Live Mode.

  
**Note:** This feature is designed to enhance user engagement by streamlining communication pathways. It’s perfect for businesses looking to automate and simplify interactions.
