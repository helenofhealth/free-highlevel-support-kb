# **What Is the Mobile Progress Bar for Surveys & Quizzes?**

  
The mobile progress bar adds a dynamic fill line to multi-step surveys and quizzes when viewed on mobile devices. It stays hidden on desktop and single-step forms, keeping the interface clean while delivering clarity where it matters most. This helps increase form completion rates by giving users visibility into where they are and how much is left to go.

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

  
**Q: Does the progress bar appear on desktop?**

No. It is mobile‑only; desktop users will see the standard indicators.

  
**Q: Why is the Enable Progress Bar toggle in grayed-out in Footer settings?**

Switch the builder’s device selector to Phone first. While in desktop mode, the toggle is not selectable.

  
**Q: What if my survey or quiz has only one step?**

The progress bar is automatically hidden on single step surveys and quizzes because there is no progress to show.

  
**Q: Does the progress bar work with both "Stick to Card" and "Stick to Page" footer types?** 

Yes. It aligns seamlessly with both Stick to card and Stick to page footers.

  
**Q: Will my existing multi‑step surveys and quizzes automatically show the progress bar?**

No. The feature is off by default and must be activated individually in each survey and quiz.
