## Things to Know

* If you’re using conditional logic, turning this on may affect how logic works. You’ll see a warning before anything changes.![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155047225021/original/cWyMgmSOjPU3IRWsJ3RKPx1sZVyEWDBlkQ.png?1748265464)
* This setting only changes how the survey is displayed it doesn’t remove or modify your questions.
