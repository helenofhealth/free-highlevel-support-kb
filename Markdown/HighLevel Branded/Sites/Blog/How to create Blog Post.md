1. **Status**: The post can be in Draft, Publish (today or in the past), or Schedule (in the future) mode.
2. **Record Keeping**: Give the post a URL slug, Category, Author, and Keywords so your overall Blog is well organized.
3. **SEO**: Set your Post's Title, Alt text, Cover Image, and Description. Preview all the changes.
4. **Done**: When everything is configured, click the button in the upper right. It will be Draft, Publish, or Schedule depending on the Status you selected.
