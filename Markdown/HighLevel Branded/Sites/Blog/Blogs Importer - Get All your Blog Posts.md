## **What Is Blog Post Importer?**

  
If you already have a blog outside of HighLevel, you can use Blog Post Importer to automatically scrape the blog and create posts in HighLevel. No need to rewrite, copy & paste, download & upload, etc. Just set it and wait for the process to finish.

**Sitemap**  
  
Ensure you have a public sitemap before you try to import blog posts from your blog. The sitemap is necessary for the mapping and scraping. For example, blog.abc.com/**sitemap.xml.**  
  
**Supported Blogs**  
  
Currently Hubspot and Wordpress are supported. We do not yet support Wix, Medium, etc.

  
### **Step 3: Start Importer**

On the Import Blog Posts from URL page you will see three phases. Start with **Setup your Import**: Enter your blog homepage, a recent post, and your platform. When you click Continue you will see that you have to wait for the mapping to complete.

When you are done mapping the content you will return to the Blog Post List > Imported Contents tab and you will see an **Import In Progress** pill.

  
**Import Time** 
  
Expect about 10-20 minutes for 1,000 posts.

**Scan/Results Error**
If the blog sitemap doesn't have a URL, then the blog posts cannot be imported. Currently you will seeÂ 'Scan in progress' for the interim 'Failure' state which upon clicking shows a blank page.

When the import is done you will see the pill change to **Import Done**.
