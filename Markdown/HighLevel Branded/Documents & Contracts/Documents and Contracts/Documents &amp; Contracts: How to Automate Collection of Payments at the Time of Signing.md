## What's New?

We are excited to introduce **Recurring Invoice Generation** integrated directly into our 2-in-1 Documents & Contracts feature. This enhancement allows users to automate the creation and management of recurring invoices seamlessly at the time of document signing. Key updates include:

* **Automated Settings Drawer:** When adding a product list to a new template or document, clicking the product list automatically opens the settings drawer for easy configuration.

* **Automatic Recurring Type Assignment:** Adding a recurring product changes its type to recurring automatically.
* **Price Type Tags:** Visual tags indicate whether a product is one-time or recurring, helping users differentiate between pricing types.

* **Flexible Invoice Scheduling:** Users can now choose to generate invoices immediately upon signing or based on a fixed schedule relative to the signing date.

4. **Distinguish Product Types:**  
   * The product list will display distinctions between one-time and recurring products.  
   * **Note:**  
         * **One-Time Products:** Always treated as one-time payments.  
         * **Recurring Products with Setup Fee:** Displayed as two line items—one for the recurring payment and another for the one-time setup fee.  
         * Only recurring products will be billed in subsequent invoices sent

### Configuring Recurring Invoice settings within the product list

1. **Generate Invoice at Signing:**  
   * **Toggle On:**Creates a recurring invoice schedule with the first invoice generated at the time of signing. Subsequent invoices follow the defined frequency (e.g., monthly).  
         * _Example:_ If a document is signed on January 25th with a monthly schedule, the next invoice is sent on February 25th.  
   * **Toggle Off:** Allows users to set a specific date for the invoice to be sent, regardless of the signing date.
2. **Enable Direct Payment:**  
   * **Toggle On:** Redirects the primary signer directly to the invoice page after signing and sends an email with the invoice.  
   * **Toggle Off:** The invoice is saved as a draft and can be sent manually later.
