### Overview

You can now redirect customers to a specific web page after they’ve signed your Document or completed a payment on an invoice generated via the Document. This helps create a seamless, branded experience—whether that’s showing them a thank-you page, leading them to a scheduling link, or upselling additional services.  
  
### 1\. Enable Global Custom URL Redirection

1. **Navigate to Documents & Contracts**  
   * In the left menu, go to **Payments** → **Documents & Contracts**.
2. **Open Settings**  
   * Click the **Settings** button at the top-right (gear icon).  
   * Select **Document Settings** from the sidebar.
3. **Toggle on “Redirect to a Custom URL”**  
   * Flip the switch to enable it globally for all Documents.  
   * Enter the URL (e.g., `https://example.com`).  
   * Choose **Open in Existing Tab** or **Open in New Tab**.
4. **Save Your Changes**  
   * Click **Save** to confirm.

> **Note:** Global settings will not override a custom URL added directly to a specific Document or Template.

3. **Enable Redirect & Enter URL**  
   * Toggle on **Enable redirection to custom URL**.  
   * Enter the desired URL.  
   * Select if it should open in the same tab or a new tab.

### 3\. Redirection After Payment

If you’ve enabled a Payment option within your Document, the same redirect settings apply once payment is made:

* **Global Setting**: If enabled, your customers are automatically redirected after their payment is processed.
* **Document-Level Setting**: If you’ve enabled and specified a URL here, it takes priority for that specific Document.

### 4\. Troubleshooting & Tips

* **Test Before Sending**: Use the **Preview** option in Documents to confirm that the redirect works as expected.
* **Override Logic**: Document-specific redirects will override global redirects. Turn off or remove the Document-level setting if you want to rely solely on the global redirect.

### 5\. Common Use Cases

* **Thank-You Pages**: Direct new signers/payers to a personalized thank-you or confirmation page.
* **Onboarding**: Prompt customers to complete onboarding steps immediately after signing.
* **Upsells**: Show complementary offers or scheduling pages to drive further engagement.
* **Reviews:** Get reviews from your users after they've signed a completion agreement.
