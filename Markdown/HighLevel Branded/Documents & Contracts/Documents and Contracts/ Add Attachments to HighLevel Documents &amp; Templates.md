# **Overview of Attaching Files to Documents & Templates**

  
You are able to upload multiple files (SVG, PNG, JPG, or PDF files, up to 15 MB each) directly inside any document or template. When the document is sent, manually or through a Workflow, those files arrive in your recipient’s inbox as standard, downloadable email attachments. This enables you to send a single email that contains both the contract and all supporting documents.

## **Key Benefits of Adding Attachments**

  
* **Single‑Email Delivery**: Clients receive the contract plus supporting materials in one message, reducing confusion and speeding sign‑off
* **No Extra Tools Required**: Eliminate third‑party file‑sharing links for a seamless sender and recipient experience
* **Workflow‑Ready**: Attachments ride along automatically when documents are triggered by Workflows—no extra configuration needed
* **Easy File Management**: Upload, preview progress, or delete files directly from the Document Settings panel before sending
* **No External Download Links**: Recipients can open attachments directly from the email, reducing extra clicks, boosting trust, and minimizing phishing concerns
