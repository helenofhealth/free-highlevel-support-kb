# **What is Automatic Invoice Creation After Document Signing?**

  
Automatic Invoice Creation ensures that once a lead signs a contract or document containing a product list, HighLevel automatically generates a corresponding invoice. This bridges the gap between client agreement and billing, saving time and reducing manual errors.

  
The feature works only if the signed document includes one or more product list elements with line items.

## **Key Benefits of Automatic Invoice Creation**

  
This feature streamlines post-signature invoicing and ensures accuracy in billing. Here are the key benefits:

  
* **Automation:** Invoices are generated automatically, eliminating the need for manual invoice creation.

  
* **Accuracy:** All product list elements, line items, discounts, and taxes are carried over exactly as defined in the signed document.

  
* **Consolidation:** If multiple product lists exist in one document, a single cumulative invoice is created.

  
* **Editability:** Users can view and edit the auto-generated invoice before sending it.

  
* **Efficiency:** Reduces turnaround time between client agreement and invoice delivery.

## **Viewing Auto-Generated Invoices**

  
Once a document is signed, and if it contains valid product list items, users can access the generated invoice directly from the Completed tab under the Documents & Contracts section.

  
### **Access Documents & Contracts**

  
Start by navigating to the **Payments** tab from the left-hand menu. Then, under the “Documents & Contracts” dropdown, click on **All Documents & Contracts** to view your document activity.

### **Open Completed Documents**

  
Click the **Completed** tab to filter and view only those documents that have been signed and finalized. These entries are eligible for auto-generated invoices if product lists were included.

### **View the Invoice**

  
Click the **three-dot menu (⋮)** next to the finalized document entry and select **“View Invoice.”** This opens the auto-generated invoice so you can review, edit, or send it to the client.

## **Conditions for Automatic Invoice Generation**

  
Understanding when an invoice will or will not be generated helps ensure you set up documents correctly.

  
* An invoice will be created if the document contains at least one product list element with line items.

  
* An invoice will NOT be created if no product list elements are present in the document.

  
* If the document contains multiple product list elements, a single invoice will be created consolidating all line items and discounts.

  
This logic ensures billing is only initiated when applicable, avoiding empty or irrelevant invoices.

## **How To Setup Auto-Invoice Documents**

  
Setting up auto-invoice-enabled documents is simple if you incorporate the right elements in your templates.

  
### **Open Template Library**

  
Go to the **Payments** tab, open the **Documents & Contracts** dropdown, and select **Templates**. This view lets you access or manage templates used to create signable documents.

### **Create or Edit Template**

  
Click **\+ New** to create a new document or select an existing template to make updates. During this step, you’ll structure the document and add key billing components like products, pricing, discounts, and taxes. This setup is essential for triggering automatic invoice creation once the document is signed.

### **Finalize Template Details**

  
Once your template includes all product-related elements—such as line items, pricing, taxes, and discounts, go back to the templates Library and click the **three-dot menu (⋮)** next to your desired Template and select **“Use Template.”** This step activates the recipient assignment flow and prepares the document for sending.

### **Assign the Recipient**

  
Once the document is fully set up with product details, taxes, and pricing, click the **Recipient icon** to access the assignment panel. You’ll be able to select or add a **Primary Client**, which is required before sending the document and triggering automatic invoice creation.

### **Send the Document**

  
After selecting a recipient and reviewing all contract details, click **Send** in the top-right corner. This action sends the document for signature and, once signed, automatically triggers invoice creation based on the defined line items.
