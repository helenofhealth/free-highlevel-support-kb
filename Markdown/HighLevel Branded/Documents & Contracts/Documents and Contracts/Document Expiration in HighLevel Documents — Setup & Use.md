## What is Document Expiration?

Document Expiration is a feature in HighLevel that allows users to set an expiration timeline for documents sent for signature. Once a document reaches its expiration date, it is automatically marked as expired and becomes inaccessible for signing or form completion by recipients. This function supports accuracy and control in time-sensitive workflows such as contracts, onboarding documents, and compliance forms.

## Key Benefits of Document Expiration

Document Expiration is designed to enhance document lifecycle management by introducing time-bound control and communication. It provides administrative teams with greater oversight and accountability.

* Ensures contracts and forms are signed within a valid timeframe
* Prevents outdated or obsolete documents from being acted upon
* Automatically marks expired documents, reducing manual tracking
* Improves visibility with expiration status in the dashboard
* Provides a consistent user experience with on-document expiry notices
* Enables optional reminder notifications to encourage timely action

## How to Enable Document Expiration

This section explains how to activate Document Expiry settings globally at the location level to ensure consistency across all documents.

The countdown begins from the time the document is sent and aligns with the location’s timezone for precision.

  
## What Happens When a Document Expires?

Once a document reaches its expiration date, several actions take place automatically to ensure clarity and enforceability.

* The document’s status is updated to Expired in the document list view
* Recipients attempting to access the document will see a notification indicating the document has expired
* Signatures or data input will be disabled, preserving the document’s integrity
* Senders may resend the document or contact recipients for further action

## Notifications and Customization Options

Administrators can choose to send recipients a reminder email 1 day before a document’s expiration. These notifications help reduce the risk of delays and incomplete submissions.

Customization options include:

* Subject line
* Email body content
* Branding and sender identification

These reminders can be enabled globally or on a per-document basis, offering full flexibility based on business needs.

## Frequently Asked Questions

Q: Can I change the expiry date after the document has been sent?  
 No. Once a document is sent, the expiry date is fixed. To change it, a new document must be created and sent.

Q: Are reminder emails enabled by default?  
 No. Reminder notifications must be manually enabled either at the global settings level or per document.

Q: What happens to documents after they expire?  
 Documents are marked as “Expired” but remain accessible in the dashboard for reference. They can no longer be signed or edited by recipients.

Q: Will recipients be notified when a document expires?  
 Recipients will see a message on the document page stating that the document has expired. However, there is no automatic post-expiry notification unless configured externally.

Q: Can I disable the Document Expiry feature after enabling it?  
 Yes. You can return to the settings panel and toggle off the feature at any time.

Q: Is the expiry time based on the recipient’s time zone?  
 No. Document expiry is calculated using the sender's location timezone to maintain consistency.
