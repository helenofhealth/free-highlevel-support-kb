## What’s New?

* **Linked Text and Date Fields:** We have added the ability to link text and date fields to contact custom values in Documents and Contracts.
* **Flexible Linking:** Users can now link fields in a document to custom values, either for contacts or for the document itself.
* **Automatic Updates:** Once a document is signed, the linked fields are automatically updated in the contact or document records.
* **CSV Download:** Users can download a CSV of all the filled fields from the dashboard for easier tracking and data management.

## How to Use

1. **Link Fields to Custom Values:**  
   * In the **Documents and** **Contracts** section, open the editor and create a new document and drag a text or date field wherever needed.
2. **Add a Recipient and Link Fields:**  
   * Add a recipient, and select the link button on top of text and date fields.  
   * Link a single field to multiple custom values if needed.

3. **Automatic Updates Upon Signing:**  
   * Once the recipient signs the document, the linked fields will automatically update in the corresponding record (contact or document).
4. **Download Filled Fields Data:**  
   * To view all the filled fields in a document, simply go to the dashboard and download a CSV with the relevant data.

## Why We Built It

* **Reduced Manual Updates:** Linking text and date fields to custom values reduces the need for manual updates after documents are signed, allowing for automated data syncing to contacts.
* **Convenient Data Management:** The option to download a CSV gives users a convenient way to manage and analyze data from filled fields, streamlining their document processes.

## What’s Next?

* **Support for Opportunity Custom Values:** We are working on extending support to include opportunity custom values.
