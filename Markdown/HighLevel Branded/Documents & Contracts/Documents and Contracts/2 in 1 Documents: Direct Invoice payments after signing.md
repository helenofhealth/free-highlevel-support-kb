## Send from a **New Document** 

1. Go to **Payments › Documents & Contracts › New Document**.

3. **Add Product List**. Item types determine whether the list is **One‑time** or **Recurring**; **tags** appear automatically.

   1. If a One time product is added - The invoice type is set to One time.  
   \- You can select a product and change it to an optional item and make its quantities editable if needed from the properties section in the right.  
   \- From the Payments section in the left side - you can set the configurations as per your need.

   2. If one or more recurring product is added in the product list -> the invoice type changes to Recurring. One document can only have one recurring frequency which can be chosen from the Invoice frequency settings in the left.

4. Pick configurations you need (see quick callouts; full details in **Configurations** below):  
   * **Direct Payment — ON:** Redirect primary signer to pay **after signing** if an invoice exists at signing.  
   * **Send Invoice — ON:** Email the invoice when it’s generated (at signing or on the schedule).  
   * **Auto‑Payment — ON:** Autocharge future recurring invoices.  
   * **Live Mode = true:** Real transactions; **false** for test/dry‑run.
5. **Send** the document.
6. **What happens at signing**  
   * **One‑time:** Primary signer is **redirected to invoice** to pay immediately.  
   * **Recurring (start = at signing):** Primary signer is **redirected** to pay the first invoice immediately.  
   * **Recurring (start = later):** No redirect at signing; first invoice is created/sent on the schedule.  
   * Only the **primary signer** is redirected. Others just sign. An invoice email is also sent when enabled.

## Configurations 

### Direct Payment

* **ON:** If an invoice exists at signing, the **primary signer** is redirected to the invoice page immediately after signing; invoice email also goes out.
* **OFF:** No redirect; payer uses the emailed invoice (or you send it later from drafts).

### Send Invoice

* **ON:** Automatically emails the invoice when generated (at signing or on schedule).
* **OFF:** Keeps the invoice as **draft** so you can review and send manually.

### Auto‑Payment

* **ON:** Saves card (supported gateways) and **autocharges** subsequent invoices in the recurring schedule or ones with payment schedules.
* **OFF:** Payer pays each issued invoice manually.

> Auto‑Payment affects **recurring** schedules. One‑time is paid during the immediate checkout.

### Live Mode (true/false)

* **true (Live):** Real charges with your live credentials.
* **false (Test):** Test flow without collecting real funds (availability depends on gateway test mode).
  
  
## How to Automate 2 in 1 Documents: Save as a **Template** & Automate with **Send Documents & Contracts** Action

1. Go to **Payments › Documents & Contracts › Templates › New Template**.
2. Insert **Signature** fields and **Add Product List** (types + tags auto).
3. For recurring, choose **when** the schedule starts: **at signing** or on a **future date/day**.
4. Configure **Direct Payment / Send Invoice / Auto‑Payment / Live Mode** as needed.
5. **Save** the template.

6. Open **Workflows** → add **Action: Send Documents & Contracts** → select your template. Once the workflow is triggered, the signer receives the document. Once Primary user signs the document -> they are redirected to the invoice if direct payments were enabled.

7. **What happens at signing** (same rules):  
   * One‑time or Recurring (start = at signing) → **redirect** primary signer to pay.  
   * Recurring (start = later) → **no redirect**; first invoice arrives per schedule.

  
##   
Tracking

* **Payments › Documents & Contracts:** Document + signing + payment status in one place.
* **Payments › Invoices:** Each invoice record and payment status (including recurring schedule progress and auto‑payment results).

##   
Tips & Edge Cases

* **Weekly example:** If the schedule is **every Thursday** and signing completes on Thursday, the first invoice is generated **immediately** → redirect applies. Otherwise, the first invoice is sent on the **next Thursday**.
* **Multiple recipients:** Only the **primary signer** is redirected to pay.
* **Setup fees:** Show as a **one‑time** line on the first invoice; only the recurring line continues.
* **Mixing items:** One‑time items bill on the first invoice; recurring items follow the schedule.

## FAQs

1. **Why didn’t my client get redirected after signing?**  
Either **Direct Payment** is OFF, or there wasn’t an invoice **at signing** (e.g., recurring starts later). Enable Direct Payment and, for recurring, set start = **at signing**.
2. **Where do I track progress?**  
In **Documents & Contracts** (document-level status) and **Invoices** (invoice/payment status, schedules, auto‑payment results).
3. **Can I mix one‑time and recurring items?**  
Yes. The product list tags show types. One‑time bills first; recurring continues as per the schedule.
