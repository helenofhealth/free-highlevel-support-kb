## Composing Your Message

### Compliance in your SMS body

* Seek consent from your text recipient before including them in your SMS campaign
* Always identify yourself and your business by name.
* If it’s the first time you’re messaging a contact, OR if it’s been 90 days or more since you last messaged them, be sure to add an unsubscribe clause at the very end of your message.  
   * “Reply STOP to opt out.”  
   * “If you’d like us to stop texting you, just reply STOP.”  
   * If someone opts out of receiving future texts, be sure to remove them from your future SMS campaigns!

  
### Strategic Best Practices

* Greet each contact by using the first name custom value → {{contact.first\_name}}
* Use sparingly, no more than once per month  
   * Respect people’s time and attention by only sending in specific time windows that are least likely to disturb personal time
* For measurable results, use a strong offer  
   * Make your message clear and concise to avoid turning people off and increasing unsubscribes.  
   * Consider offering something for free to maximize interest or responses  
         * Minimal commitment now = maximum number of conversations that will build trust and belief throughout the sales process
* Keep messages short and exciting  
   * Think about how your message will make the average contact feel  
   * Avoid needless punctuation, specifically overuse of exclamation points, to increase reading speed  
   * Avoid formal writing styles and match the casual tone of a typical text message conversation
* Spark conversations  
   * Creating live conversations = a direct connection with a potential customer  
         * It builds trust  
         * Which leads to increased sales momentum  
         * Which builds your reputation  
   * Ask a direct question to prompt responses  
   * Do not ask more than one question, as this can cause confusion  
   * Do not overuse emojis  
   * Avoid sending links  
         * This can cause deliverability issues  
         * It also neglects all the great benefits of chat conversations
* Only send out messages when you know you can respond in a timely manner  
   * Contacts who respond right away and then never hear back will think your message was sent in bulk or spam  
   * As such, contacts who get responses right away will be more likely to convert
* Be prepared for unsubscribes  
   * You will always get some people responding STOP  
   * You will always get some people to ask not to be texted anymore  
   * Respect their wishes, mark them DND, and move on

  
### Bad Example

“Hello, this is Ashley from Bob’s Fitness ?? We’re the best gym in town! All our members are models! It’s ? $175/month ? to join and there’s an extra $150 new member fee ?… We have a lot of spots to fill so we hope you can afford it! We also have personal training, group classes, a 6 week challenge, nutrition plans, sauna, ice baths, an inner circle club, work-trade spots available, and many other add-ons!”

  
### Good Example

“Hi {{contact.first\_name}}, this is Ashley from Bob’s Fitness, we’re giving out a few 10-day passes and I wondered if you’d like one? If you’d like for us to stop texting you, reply STOP”
