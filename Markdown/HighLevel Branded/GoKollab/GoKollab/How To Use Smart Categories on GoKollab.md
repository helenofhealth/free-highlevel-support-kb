# What is Smart Categorization?

Smart Categorization uses AI to automatically tag your courses and communities with the most relevant category. This helps ensure your content is easily found by learners and community members looking for specific topics.

# Key Benefits of Smart Categorization

Smart Categorization simplifies content organization and maximizes your reach without extra effort.

* Boosts discoverability in search results and category filters.
* Eliminates manual setup—no need to select categories yourself.
* Auto-updates as your content evolves, keeping categorization accurate over time.
* Improves visibility, making your offerings easier to find and more engaging.
* Reduces human error, ensuring consistency across all products.
* Saves time, so you can focus on creating great content.

# How Does Smart Categorization Work?

Smart Categorization uses advanced AI models to analyze your course or community’s:

* Title
* Description
* About section

Based on this information, the system suggests and applies the most fitting category. As your content changes, the categorization automatically updates to reflect those changes—no manual re-tagging needed.

# How to Optimize Your Content for Better Categorization

Writing clear, focused content helps the AI assign the most relevant category to your product. Here’s how to make the most of it:

* Use specific and descriptive titles that reflect your topic clearly (e.g., "Digital Marketing for Coaches" vs. "Marketing 101").
* Add keyword-rich descriptions that explain the purpose, audience, and scope of your content.
* Update your 'About' section with relevant information to support accurate classification.
* Avoid vague language like “a bit of everything” or “general info,” which can confuse the AI.

# Important Notes

Categories appear visually on every course and community thumbnail. This visibility makes it especially important to maintain accurate, descriptive content.

AI categorization ensures that users find what they’re looking for faster, so always check that your product content communicates clearly and matches your intended topic.
