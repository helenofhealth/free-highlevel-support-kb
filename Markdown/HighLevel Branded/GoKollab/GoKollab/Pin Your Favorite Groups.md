## **Overview**

To help users navigate faster and stay connected to their most important groups, GoKollab now allows you to **pin your favorite groups** for quick access. Pinned groups are displayed at the top of the dedicated group sidebar, making it easier to jump into the spaces you use most.

Whether you're in **GoKollab** or within your **Communities**, this feature ensures your top groups are just a click away.

## **Key Benefits**

* Quickly access your most-used groups
* Keep key groups visible at all times
* Simplifies navigation within both GoKollab and Communities

## **How Group Pinning Works?**

* Users can pin up to **4 groups** in both **GoKollab** and **Communities**.
* In **GoKollab**, **only pinned groups** are shown in the group sidebar.
* In **Communities**, **pinned groups appear first**, followed by the remaining groups under the sub-account.

2. Scroll to find the group you want to pin.
3. Hover over the group card to reveal a **pin icon** on the right.
4. Click the pin icon to pin the group.

## **How to Unpin a Group?**
