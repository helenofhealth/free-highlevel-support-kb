### **Custom Object Support in Snapshots**

You can now include custom objects and **all** their associated custom fields (not limited to primary fields) within snapshots. This enables you to effortlessly copy custom object data across multiple sub-accounts.

  
Custom Objects can **only** be copied between sub-accounts. Direct export of custom objects is not supported

  
---

### **Custom Object Associations**

Custom objects are automatically associated with other custom objects or contacts within the snapshot process. Associations are included by default and **cannot** be modified or deselected during snapshot creation.

  
Associations between custom objects and other objects (including contacts) will be automatically created or updated. You cannot manually edit these associations during the snapshot process.

### **How to Copy Custom Objects Between Sub-Accounts**

3. The selected custom object’s fields and associations (to other custom objects or contacts) will automatically be included.
4. Choose the **source and target sub-accounts** to complete the snapshot transfer.

### **Important Limitations**

* **Custom Object Limit per Snapshot:**  
A snapshot can contain a maximum of **three custom objects** per sub-account. If importing the snapshot would exceed this limit, **no custom objects will be created** in the target sub-account.
