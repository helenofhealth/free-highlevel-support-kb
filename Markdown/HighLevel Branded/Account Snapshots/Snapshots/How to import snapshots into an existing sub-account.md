# **What is Loading a Snapshot into an Existing Account?**

  
Loading a snapshot into an existing account means importing prebuilt HighLevel assets like workflows, funnels, emails, and more into a sub-account that is already active. This approach allows agencies to quickly deploy standardized systems to clients without recreating them manually. Unlike creating a new account with a snapshot, this method preserves existing client data and adds or updates selected assets.

## **Key Benefits of Loading a Snapshot into an Existing Account**

  
Loading a snapshot is a strategic way to duplicate assets across multiple clients.

  
* **Efficiency**: Speeds up setup by reusing workflows, forms, and other assets
* **Consistency**: Ensures that sub-accounts follow the same structure and processes
* **Flexibility**: Gives you control over which assets are imported and which existing assets are overridden
* **Conflict Warnings**: See what might be overridden before taking action

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

  
**Q: Will loading a snapshot delete my current data?**  
No. Data is only replaced if you choose to override during the conflict check.  
  
**Q: Can I preview what’s in the snapshot?**  
Not directly. However, you can load selectively and skip assets during the process.  
  
**Q: What happens if I accidentally override an asset?**  
The action cannot be undone. Always review the conflict list carefully.  
  
**Q: Can I load multiple snapshots into the same sub-account?**  
Yes, you can load more than one snapshot into the same sub-account. Each time you load a snapshot, you’ll go through the same process. Just be aware that overlapping assets may trigger conflicts, so review your selections carefully to avoid unintended overrides.
