You can view a history of all the times you pushed an update to a snapshot into subaccounts. You can see subaccounts processed, pending, and failed. You can also see the details of assets loaded in each subaccount.

  
As of 2024-Nov-12 the asset level details might say Completed even if less than 100% of the assets loaded (ex: only 5 out of 10 funnels were loaded). This is being improved.
