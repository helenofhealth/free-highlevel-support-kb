# **Overview of Creating a Sub-Account Using a Snapshot**

  
Creating a sub-account using a snapshot allows agencies to easily create a new account that includes all the tools, workflows, settings, and assets packaged in the selected snapshot. Once the sub-account is created, the snapshot is automatically loaded into it, eliminating the need for manual loading of a snap-shot after creation. This streamlines the onboarding process and ensures the new account starts with a consistent, prebuilt setup.

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

  
**Q: Can I delete a snapshot from an account after it's created?**  
No, once applied, a snapshot cannot be “unloaded" or "deleted". You can delete or modify specific elements manually.  
  
**Q: What access is needed to create sub-accounts using snapshots?**  
Only users with Agency Admin permissions can perform this action.  
  
**Q: What assets are included in snapshots?**  
Funnels, forms, workflows, calendars, settings, and more depending on what was saved in the snapshot. For more information, read [Snapshot Overview](https://help.gohighlevel.com/en/support/solutions/articles/48000982511).

  
**Q: Will the snapshot overwrite anything in the new sub-account?**  
No. Since the sub-account is being created fresh, there is nothing to overwrite. The snapshot is applied during account creation, so its contents become the initial setup.

  
**Q: Can I apply more than one snapshot to a new sub-account?**  
Not during the creation process. Only one snapshot can be selected when creating a sub-account. However, you can manually apply additional snapshots after the sub-account has been created.
