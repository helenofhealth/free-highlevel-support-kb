This article explains how HighLevel’s “rolling notifications” improve the experience of pushing snapshots to multiple sub-accounts. Instead of receiving a separate notification for every location, grouped updates keep your notifications cleaner and easier to follow.

  
**Please Note:** This article only explains how rolling in-app notifications are displayed during snapshot pushes.

## **What is a Snapshot Push?**

  
A snapshot push is the process of copying a predefined configuration, funnel, workflow, or entire account setup from one HighLevel account (often an agency template) into another sub-account. This allows agencies to quickly deploy a standardized setup across multiple client accounts without rebuilding each one from scratch.

## **What Is the Rolling Notification Feature?** 

  
Rolling Notifications streamline how notifications are delivered when pushing a snapshot to multiple sub-accounts. Previously, users received a separate notification for every location. Now, when pushing to more than 10 sub-accounts, notifications are grouped and sent at progress intervals (10%, 30%, 70%, 100%).

---

## **Key Benefits of Rolling Notifications** 

  
Grouped notifications reduce clutter and improve visibility into snapshot progress.

  
* Reduces notification overload when pushing to 10+ sub-accounts.
* Delivers grouped progress updates at 4 key milestones (10%, 30%, 70%, 100%).
* Maintains individual notifications for fewer than 10 sub-accounts.
* Helps admins monitor large snapshot pushes more easily.
* No change required — this update is automatically enabled.
* Retains visibility into failed snapshot pushes with individual alerts.

## **Snapshot Pushed to 10 or fewer sub-accounts**

  
If you push a snapshot to fewer than 10 locations, you’ll receive an individual notification for each location, just as before.

## **Smart Notification Grouping (Snapshot pushed to more than 10 sub-accounts)**

  
Smart Notification Grouping is at the heart of this feature, prioritizing both clarity and efficiency. It categorizes the notification strategy based on the number of target locations during a snapshot push.

  
* For pushes to fewer than 10 locations, individual notifications are delivered as done previously, offering detailed insights for each location.
* When deploying to 10 or more locations, notifications are consolidated into rolling alerts triggered at key milestones—10%, 30%, 70%, and finally 100% of the locations processed.
* This grouping strategy reduces clutter and helps you focus on overall progress while still keeping critical stages visible.

## **Individual Failure Notifications**

  
Individual Failure Notifications ensure that no error goes unnoticed, even when using the consolidated rolling system.

  
* Each failed snapshot push generates its own notification to draw immediate attention.
* This targeted alert system enables rapid troubleshooting and minimizes the risk of systemic issues remaining unresolved.
* The approach helps maintain complete transparency throughout the snapshot process, setting the stage for better maintenance and faster resolutions.

**IMPORTANT**: Every milestone or failure alert contains a blue “View Details” link that opens Snapshot → Push History pre-filtered to that deployment, saving you multiple clicks.

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

  
**Q: What determines whether I receive individual or rolling notifications?**

If you push a snapshot to fewer than 10 locations, you’ll get individual notifications; for 10 or more locations, notifications are grouped into rolling alerts at key milestones.
  
  
**Q: How many rolling notifications should I expect during a large-scale push?**

You will receive four consolidated notifications at the 10%, 30%, 70%, and 100% progress milestones.
  
  
**Q: Are notifications for snapshot push failures also consolidated?**

No, each failed push generates its own individual notification for immediate attention.
  
  
**Q: How can I view more details about a snapshot push?**

Every notification includes a “View Details” link that takes you directly to the full snapshot push history.
  
  
**Q: Can I turn off grouped notifications?**  
No, this is a system-level enhancement and cannot be toggled.
