A snapshot is a template of a particular sub-account that is used to transfer items such as Funnels, Calendars, Workflows, Websites, Custom Values, Trigger Links, Message templates, etc., to another account. The idea behind this feature is that it allows the agency owner to build and customize many different assets and settings so they can be applied to new accounts, thereby minimizing the amount of work that needs to be done when it is created.
