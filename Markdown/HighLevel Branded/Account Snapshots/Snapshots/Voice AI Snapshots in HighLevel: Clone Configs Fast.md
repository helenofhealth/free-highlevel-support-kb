# **What is Voice AI Snapshot?**

  
Voice AI Snapshots are a powerful tool that lets you clone your complete Voice AI setup and apply it to other sub-accounts within HighLevel. It builds on our existing snapshot technology, extending it to include Voice AI agents, settings, workflows, and more — minus the assigned phone number. This feature is especially useful for agencies managing multiple client accounts or businesses scaling Voice AI across brands.
