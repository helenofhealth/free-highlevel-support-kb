# **What is a Snapshot?**

  
Snapshot creation allows agency users to duplicate an existing sub-account's setup, which can then be loaded into other sub-accounts. This process is especially useful when onboarding new clients, maintaining brand consistency, or scaling a service offering efficiently. Once a snapshot is created, it can be used multiple times across multiple sub-accounts.

## **Key Benefits of Snapshots**

  
* **Reusability:** Create templates for recurring client types or agency packages that can be reused anytime.
* **Workflow consistency:** Maintain standardized setups across multiple client accounts for streamlined operations.
* **Selective asset control:** Include everything or choose specific assets to tailor snapshots to your use case.
* **Faster onboarding:** Reduce setup time when launching new subaccounts by loading a prebuilt configuration.
* **Version safety**: Preserve your original configuration before making big changes to a client’s setup.
