## **How It Works**

1. Open the mobile app and tap on the hamburger menu on the top left.
2. Tap on Invoices. You will see 2 widgets depicting the amount you have collected from your invoices and the amount that is yet to be paid. You will also be able to see a list of all the invoices that you have created for that subaccount, either on mobile or on web. You can use the left swipe gesture on the invoice to reveal the primary actions (based on the status of the invoice) - e.g. for an invoice that is due, you will see the option to Edit, Record Payment and More that reveals all the actions you can perform on that invoice.
3. To create a new invoice, tap on the floating + button on the bottom right of the screen. Choose between a one-time invoice and a recurring invoice.
4. The first step will be to fill out the initial details - Recipient of the Invoice, Start date, and Due date. In case you chose recurring invoice, you will have the option to configure the frequency of payments.
5. The second step involves adding items to your invoice. Choose items from your product catalog or add custom items with a note using the keypad section. Select the right variants (if applicable), adjust the quantity, and select the applicable taxes.
6. The third step allows you to review your terms and notes. Here you can lay down the terms of this invoice, including information about late fee if the invoice isn't paid on time.
7. Finally, the fourth step involves you reviewing the invoice. You can adjust the quantity of the items, change the recipient, and even add a discount. You can also see a web preview of the invoice by tapping on the Preview button present on the top right of the screen.
8. Once your invoice looks good to go, tap on Send. This will open up a bottom sheet where you can select the right channel to send your invoice. You can choose to send the invoice via either email, sms, or both (make sure that your contact has an email as well as a phone number).
9. There you go! You have just sent out your invoice. To record a payment for this invoice, just head over to the Invoice list, navigate to the relevant invoice card, left swipe the card and tap on Record Payment. You will be able to record payment using tap to pay, cash, cards on file, or manual entry.
