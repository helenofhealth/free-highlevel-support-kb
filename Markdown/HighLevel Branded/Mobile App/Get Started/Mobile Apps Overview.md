# Mobile Versus Desktop Apps

The Mobile App allows you to manage your business on the go! While it has limited features in comparison with the desktop App, it enables both you and your users to manage and grow from anywhere. 

  
You will likely encounter limitations on the mobile app that require you to log into the Desktop App to manage or create. For example, creating a workflow. You can add someone to a workflow from the Mobile App, however, you cannot create or change the workflow until you log into your desktop app.
