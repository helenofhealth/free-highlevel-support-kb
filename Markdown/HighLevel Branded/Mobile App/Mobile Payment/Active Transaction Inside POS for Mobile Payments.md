# **What are Active Transactions?**

  
**Transactions** are records where you are currently selling something to a customer. The parties, items and amounts have been recorded in a "transaction". An **Active** Transaction is simply a Transaction that has been started but hasn't been finished yet.

  
**Active Transactions** is a feature in the mobile app POS that **consolidates all your due and overdue** invoices, estimates, and appointment payments in one place. This helps you avoid missed payments and makes it simple to collect what you're owed — quickly and on the go. You don't have to hunt through all Transactions to find the ones that still need payment.
