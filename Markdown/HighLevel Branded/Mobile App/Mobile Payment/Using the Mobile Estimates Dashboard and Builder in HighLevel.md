# **What is a Mobile Estimate?**

An estimate is typically when a skilled service technician reviews a job in-person so that they can build a precise list of the things that need to be done, the parts, supplies, personnel, and time required. This is an "estimate" because it is accurate but subject to change as the job progresses. It is extremely efficient to have a mobile system for managing estimates because the whole process can be done with the customer on-site in real time.
