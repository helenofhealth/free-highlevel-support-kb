HighLevel’s mobile app now allows you to collect in-person signatures directly within the app, making it easier than ever to finalize documents and contracts while on the go. Whether you’re in a meeting, at an event, or face-to-face with a client, you can now have recipients sign documents on your mobile device—no printing, scanning, or emailing required.

  
This functionality is available in the HighLevel, LeadConnector, and whitelabeled mobile apps. (Note: If you’re using a whitelabeled app, you may need to request an update to access this feature.)
