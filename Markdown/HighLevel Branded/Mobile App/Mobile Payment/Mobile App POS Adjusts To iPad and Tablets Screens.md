## **Split Window Mode**

On a larger device like an iPad or tablet, the POS will be split into two different screens - Console on the left and Checkout on the right. This makes transacting all the more efficient since you're always aware of what's added to the checkout without navigating back and forth.

## **Landscape or Portrait Mode**

POS now works in a horizontal (landscape) mode and vertical (portrait) mode. Based on your device orientation preference, you can use the POS comfortably with your tablet docks and associated payment hardware devices.

## **How It Works**

1. Install your preferred mobile app (HighLevel, LeadConnector, or Whitelablled) on your iPad or Android tablet.
2. Head over to the POS screen by tapping on the $ icon on the bottom bar of the app.
3. You can now see a brand new view for the POS, with the item console (keypad and catalog) on the left and checkout on the right.
4. To accept a payment, simply add the items from the left side of the screen using the keypad for custom items or the catalog for your saved items. On the right side of the screen, link the contact of the individual/entity from whom you're accepting the payment.
5. Review the item details on the right while adding items from the left. You can also add a discount to the final cost from the right side of the screen by tapping on the "Discount" button.
6. Once everything looks good to go, tap on the charge button to choose your preferred payments instrument, accept an optional tip, and complete the transaction!
