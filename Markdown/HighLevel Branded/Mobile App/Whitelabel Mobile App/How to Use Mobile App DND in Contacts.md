# **What is Mobile DND in Contact Management?**

  
The Mobile DND enhancement allows you to block calls, SMS, and other contact methods from the most relevant interaction points in the HighLevel mobile app. Rather than navigating into contact settings, you can now add numbers to your DND list instantly from the call screen, recent call logs, or the Conversations inbox.

  
## **Key Benefits of Mobile DND**

  
Take control of your communication and contact strategy with quicker access to blocking and compliance tools.

* One-tap DND access from incoming calls, call logs, and conversation threads
* Prevents DND-marked contacts from entering campaigns, workflows, and automations
* Supports selective blocking by channel (calls, SMS, email, social)
* Helps maintain compliance with outreach regulations
* Saves time by reducing multi-step navigation
* Designed to support high-volume, on-the-go communication environments

##   

## **How To Use Mobile DND**

  
Mobile DND tools give you control right where and when you need it. You can block unwanted contacts or remove distractions with minimal effort and maximum efficiency.

  
Use the options below to apply DND based on where you are in the app: during a call, reviewing your call history, or managing ongoing conversations.

##   

## **DND from Incoming Call Screen**

  
Quickly block an unwanted number during a live call using the new DND shortcut on the call screen.

  
When receiving a call:

* Tap the “DND” button on the incoming call screen
* This immediately adds the number to your DND list
* The current call ends automatically
* All future calls and messages from the number will be blocked

  
## **DND from Call Logs**

  
Add contacts to your DND list directly from your recent calls without opening the contact profile.

  
To do this:

* Go to the Call Logs section
* Tap on a recent call entry
* Select the new DND option to block future calls and messages from that number

  
This is especially useful for quickly blocking spam or unqualified leads after a missed or completed call.

  
## **DND from Conversation Swipe Action**

  
Apply DND to entire conversation threads with a simple swipe, giving you channel-specific control.

  
Steps:

1. Open the Conversations screen
2. Swipe left on any conversation
3. Tap the DND icon
4. Choose which communication channels to block (e.g., calls only, SMS, or all channels)

  
This helps maintain a clean inbox while keeping outreach efforts compliant and focused.
