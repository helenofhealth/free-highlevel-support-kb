# **What is Group Chat?**

  
**Group Chat is a mobile-first messaging feature that allows users to create a single chat thread with multiple participants.**

Rather than juggling several one-on-one conversations, users can now collaborate with multiple contacts — like families, internal teams, or entire departments — in one unified thread. This streamlines communication, reduces response delays, and improves transparency across all participants.

  
## **Key Benefits of Group Chat**

  
**Group Chat transforms how users manage communication by making it faster, collaborative, and more intuitive — directly from the mobile app.**

* **Collaborative Conversations**: Bring multiple contacts into one thread for streamlined discussions.
* **Streamlined Communication**: Keep everyone on the same page without repeating messages across chats.
* **Improved Client Engagement**: Tailor interactions by grouping related contacts (e.g., families, departments, or teams).
* **Mobile-First Convenience**: Start, manage, and continue group conversations anytime, anywhere.
* **Unified Threading**: One thread, all responses — less clutter, more clarity.
* **Better Responsiveness**: Everyone can view and reply to messages in real time.

  
## **How To Use Group Chat**

  
**Get started with Group Chat in just a few taps from the HighLevel or LeadConnector mobile app.**

Here’s how to initiate a group thread and collaborate more effectively:

1. **Open the HighLevel or LeadConnector mobile app** on your iOS or Android device.
2. **Tap the “Conversations” tab** at the bottom of your screen.
3. **Tap the floating “+” button** to begin a new conversation.
4. **Choose “Group Chat”** as the conversation type.
5. **Select your phone number** and choose multiple contacts from your list.
6. **Optionally name the group chat**, making it easy to identify later.
7. **Tap “Start Chat”** to launch the conversation instantly.

  
You can now chat with all selected contacts in one seamless thread!

## **Starting a Group Chat**

  
**Group Chats are ideal for real-time coordination and updates with multiple contacts.**

Whether you’re onboarding a family, managing a sales team, or supporting multiple decision-makers, creating a group chat ensures everyone stays informed and involved.

  
## **Managing a Group Chat**

  
**Once a group chat is live, you can communicate just like you would in a one-on-one chat.**

You can:

* Send and receive messages
* Share images or files
* Tag users by name
* View all participants in the chat

  
**Note:** Editing group names, adding/removing participants, and setting group permissions are not yet supported in beta but are coming soon in the full rollout.
