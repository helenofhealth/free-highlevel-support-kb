Say hello to the Unified Contact Workspace for the HighLevel mobile app. The Contacts Workspace pulls every detail, task, note, and activity feed for a contact onto one clean screen, adds long-press quick-actions, and lets you tag or bulk-update records in seconds. Update to v3.9 (or higher) and manage your book of business faster—without hunting through multiple menus.

# What Is the Mobile Contacts Workspace?

The Workspace replaces scattered views with a single, tab-driven hub. The contact’s essentials sit at the top, actions like Call and SMS are always one tap away, and tabs keep deep data organized yet close at hand. Everything you need now lives in one place, reducing scrolling and context-switching.

## Key Benefits of the Contacts Workspace

Understanding the “why” helps you champion the change across your team.

* All-in-one view → zero app-hops: General info, tasks, notes, and full activity feed are now stacked under one roof.
* Faster outreach: One-tap Call, SMS, or Email buttons eliminate extra taps.
* Tabbed navigation: Keep complex info tidy—switch from Details to Tasks & Notes without losing context.
* Bulk tagging: Organize hundreds of records in a few taps.
* Future-proof design: The same patterns will roll into Opportunities, Appointments, and beyond, so every module feels familiar.

## Navigating the Contacts Screen

This quick tour gets you productive in under a minute.

1. Open the Contacts tab (app v3.9 +).
2. Long-press any contact tile to pop up the quick-action tray.
3. Tap Details to explore folded sections—General Info, Additional Info, Actions, DND.
4. Swipe to Tasks & Notes or Activities via the tab bar.
5. Multi-select (••• menu → Select) to tag contacts in bulk.

## Tabs Breakdown

Tabs separate “need-right-now” info from deeper history, so you stay focused yet informed.

| Tab           | Purpose-Driven Value                                                                                                                         |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Tasks & Notes | Track to-dos and meeting notes tied to the contact—so nothing slips through the cracks.                                                      |
| Details       | View and edit general fields, custom values, actions, and DND toggles without jumping to the web.                                            |
| Activities    | Scroll a chronological feed of calls, appointments, surveys, payments, page visits, and more—perfect for quick context before you call back. |

## Tag Management & Bulk Actions

Tags keep your database tidy and power targeted campaigns; multi-select makes upkeep painless.

* Tick check-boxes to highlight multiple contacts.
* Use the bottom action bar to Add Tags or Remove Tags—changes sync instantly to the web.
* Coming soon: additional bulk actions like Delete, Assign, and DND toggle.

## Custom Values at the Contact Level

Custom values personalize outreach at scale—store them right on the contact so every text, email, or workflow pull is accurate.

* Add or edit under Details → Additional Info.
* Reference the value in any template with the usual {{custom\_value}} syntax.
* Custom values travel everywhere the contact record travels, including automated campaigns.

## Quick-Action Tiles

When speed matters, long-press beats deep menus.

* Call launches your phone dialer.
* SMS opens the in-app text composer.
* Email triggers your default mail client.
* Book Appointment connects to your calendar flow.
* Collect Payment routes to the built-in payment sheet.

Actions inherit the device defaults you already trust—no extra setup required.
