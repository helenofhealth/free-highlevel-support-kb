# **What is Inbound Call Transfer on Mobile?**

  
Inbound Call Transfer allows mobile app users to hand off incoming calls to other staff members in real time.

This feature gives you more flexibility and control while handling calls from your mobile device.

## **Warm Transfer vs Blind Transfer**

  
Understanding the difference between warm and blind transfers helps you choose the best method based on the situation.

  
**Warm Transfer**

Transfers the call while keeping you on the line, ideal for:

* Introducing another team member
* Providing customer context
* Supervising or monitoring escalations

  
**Blind Transfer**

Instantly transfers the call and disconnects you. Best for:

* Quick handoffs when you don’t need to stay involved
* Calls to external departments or third parties
* Escalating to voicemail or external numbers

##   

## **Smart Participant Management Features**

  
Smart participant controls allow you to dynamically manage who stays in the call and when — directly from your phone.

  
You can:

* View all participants via a scrollable bottom sheet
* Leave the call without ending it for others
* Remove another team member from the call
* End the entire call for all participants if needed

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

  
**Q: What’s the difference between outbound and inbound transfers?**

Inbound transfers are used when you’re receiving a call and want to pass it to someone else. Outbound transfers occur when you initiate a call and want to involve another person.

  
**Q: Can I transfer calls to external numbers?**

Yes! You can use the dial pad to transfer to external phone numbers if permitted in your user settings.

  
**Q: Is this available on all mobile versions?**

This feature is supported on:

* **HighLevel v3.97.3 and above**
* **LeadConnector v3.97.3 and above**  
For White Labeled apps, you’ll need to request the update from your provider.

  
**Q: Can I return to the call after transferring it?**

No, once you complete a blind or warm transfer (and leave), you cannot rejoin the conversation.

  
**Q: Will the caller know they are being transferred?**

There is no system-generated notification, but if you speak during a warm transfer, the caller will hear your voice and may understand the context.
