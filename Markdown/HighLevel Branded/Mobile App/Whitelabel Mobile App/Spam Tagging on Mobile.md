## What is Spam Tagging on Mobile?

Spam Tagging is a real-time call identification feature that marks potentially unwanted calls with a visible “Spam Likely” label. This labeling is applied consistently across all stages of the call experience—ranging from incoming call screens to call logs and call detail views. This functionality allows users to quickly determine whether a call should be answered, ignored, or reviewed later.

## Key Benefits of Spam Tagging

Spam Tagging improves operational efficiency by identifying suspicious calls in real time, reducing the likelihood of wasted time and unnecessary disruptions.

* Clearly flags suspicious numbers with a “Spam Likely” tag
* Functions across all key call views: incoming call screen, live call screen, call logs, and call details
* Supports both iOS and Android devices
* Requires no setup or manual activation
* Enhances focus by reducing time spent on unwanted calls
* Improves visibility for teams handling large call volumes

## How to Use Spam Tagging

Once your app is updated to the required version, Spam Tagging activates automatically. There are no manual configuration steps required. Below are the key places where Spam Tagging will appear:

### Incoming Call Screen

When a suspicious number calls, the incoming call screen will display a “Spam Likely” tag at the top of the caller ID information. This immediate warning helps users decide whether to accept or decline the call.

### In-App Call Screen

If the call is answered, the “Spam Likely” label continues to be visible on the in-call interface. This helps confirm the nature of the call throughout its duration.

### Call Logs

Open your recent call history to see the “Spam Likely” tag applied directly in the call list. This allows users to instantly identify which calls were flagged without needing to tap into each one individually.

Call Details View

Tapping on any individual call record will reveal a detailed view where the “Spam Likely” label is prominently displayed. This ensures full visibility, even if the call was missed or dismissed.
