## What is Media Optimization and Watermarking?

Media Optimization and Watermarking are enhancements within the Social Planner designed to reduce the manual workload involved in preparing visual content for social media platforms. Media Optimization automatically resizes and reformats your uploaded images based on each platform’s specifications. Watermarking applies your pre-configured brand logo or visual identifier to every image in your post, ensuring consistent branding across all platforms.

## Key Benefits of Media Optimization and Watermarking

These tools simplify your publishing workflow and ensure your brand is accurately represented, no matter where your content is shared.

* Automatically formats images to match platform-specific requirements (Instagram, Facebook, LinkedIn, etc.)
* Applies your brand watermark to all images in a post
* Enhances visual consistency and prevents off-brand posts
* Reduces reliance on third-party design or editing tools
* Minimizes formatting errors such as improper cropping or rejection due to incompatible dimensions
