## **Frequently Asked Questions**

  
**Q: What should I do if the card doesn't scan correctly or misses information?**  
Always double-check the scanned fields for accuracy. You can manually adjust any details before saving the contact. Accuracy can vary based on card design, fonts, or lighting. If the scan fails completely, try again under better lighting or on a plain background.

  
**Q: Does the scanner store a copy of the card image?**  
No, once the contact is saved, the scanned image is not retained. Only the parsed contact data is saved in your CRM.  
  
**Q: Is there a way to improve scan accuracy?**  
Yes, place the card on a flat, high-contrast background with good lighting. Avoid glares or shadows. Hold your phone steady when capturing the image.  
  
**Q: Where can I find contacts saved from the business card scanner?**  
After saving, the new contact is added to your **Contacts** tab in the app and synced to your CRM account. You can view and manage it like any other contact.
