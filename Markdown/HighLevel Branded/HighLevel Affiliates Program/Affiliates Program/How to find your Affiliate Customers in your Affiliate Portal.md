FAQ

  
Q: I referred an existing customer to HighLevel pro. Why aren't they showing in my referrals?  
  
A: When you refer an existing customer to HighLevel Pro they become a split customer. They will not show in your referrals because you are not the original affiliate that brought them to HighLevel. However, when they pay their subscription for Highlevel pro you will see the commission from that customer in your rewards tab along with that customer's email.  
  
If you want to confirm that you are a split affiliate for a customer you referred to pro. Reach out to support, with the link above!
