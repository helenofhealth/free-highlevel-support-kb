**How do I become an Affiliate Commander?**

  
Affiliate Commander status is earned by affiliates who generate at least six figures in annual commission from new referrals and/or upgrades.

  
Commander Status is not a lifetime achievement, and affiliates must remain on pace with the annual commission target to retain the title and its perks.

  
Each year’s winners are announced at the LevelUp Summit in October.
