HighLevel is excited to offer split commissions to all affiliates! 

  
When an affiliate refers someone to HighLevel, our team wants to continue to give that affiliate credit as long as the customer is active. Additionally, when a different affiliate gets that customer to upgrade, we want to give all involved affiliates credit!

  
Multiple affiliates can receive commission on one referred customer:

* The “default” or “base” affiliate that the customer initially signed up with

AND

* Affiliates who refer customers to a plan upgrade

  
This means that if one affiliate brings in a new customer, and a different affiliate refers this customer to a plan upgrade, HighLevel will give commission to both affiliates for the amazing work that they did!
  
  
**Here’s a quick example of how this works...**

  
A customer is referred to sign up for HighLevel on the Starter plan by Affiliate A. Down the line, Affiliate B refers the customer to upgrade their account from Starter ($97/mo) to Pro ($497/mo).

  
Affiliate A will continue to receive regular commission for referring the customer to the starter plan, while Affiliate B can generate commission on the difference between the two plans (about 40% of $400).

  
Note: This also works for customers who upgrade from Starter ($97/mo) to the Unlimited ($297/mo) plan under two separate affiliates! Affiliate A will continue to receive commission on the $97 plan, while Affiliate B can generate commission on the difference between the Starter and Unlimited Plan (40% of about $200).
  
  
Some HighLevel affiliates focus primarily on upgrading existing customers to earn commission, so if you’re having trouble bringing in net new customers, we recommend giving this a try!
