### **Paying**

  
These are your current active affiliate customers who are paying a HighLevel subscription. You are earning a commission on these customers every time they renew their subscription!

  
Note: You will only earn a commission on customers who pay thier subscriptions. If customers pause, cancel, or request a refund you will not get a commission for those customers.

  
### **Canceled**

These customers have canceled HighLevel subscriptions. You are currently not getting a commission on these customers. When these customers renew their subscription they will switch back to the paying category.

  
Note: There is a bug where sometimes affiliate customers will cancel a Marketplace Service and the affiliate software will temporarily mark them as “cancelled”. As soon as they make their next payment for HighLevel, their account will show as “Active” again in your account. We are aware of this problem and working on a fix. Please reach out to Support if you need any help clarifying your cancelled customers.
