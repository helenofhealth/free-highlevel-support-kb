To make compliance as easy as possible, Highlevel has partnered with a compliance software called Integrishield that will automatically check your content for compliance with HighLevel’s Affiliate Agreement and Code of Conduct. This partnership will not only help you create better content, but it will also support the continued growth of our ethical and legally compliant affiliate community, and we’re super excited about it!

  
If you receive an email from highlevel@integrishield.com or legalcompliance@gohgihelvel.com regarding some of your content, you’ll need to make required modifications to the content within 5 business days. If you have questions or believe your content was falsely flagged by Integrishield, please respond directly to this email as soon as possible so that we can help you get it figured out. (Quick Tip: be sure to add highlevel@integrishield.com and legalcompliance@gohighlevel.com to your contacts list so you don’t miss any critical notifications!)

  
Here are some specifics that may cause your content to be flagged:

* Lacking a clear and conspicuous disclosure of a partnership with HighLevel
* Discounts, promos, coupons, etc. that are not authorized by HighLevel
* Inflammatory language
* Competitor comparisons
* Unapproved trademarks
* Unapproved claims of the software’s performance

  
Please note that if you ignore any of these warnings, you may become ineligible to continue receiving commission per the [HighLevel Affiliate Policy](https://www.gohighlevel.com/affiliate-policy). We want to make absolutely sure this doesn’t happen, so if you have any questions, please reach out to your [Affiliate Manager](https://speakwith.us/affiliate) immediately! We’re always here to help.
