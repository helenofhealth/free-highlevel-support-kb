## **I have had a pending payment that looks to be stuck on my dashboard.**

  
If you have a payment that looks to be stuck on "pending" it could be that your pending affiliate customer payout is being flagged as a "self-referral"

  
to Self-referrals flags are auto-generated by FirstPromoter and are usually due to signing up at the same IP address, having the same name & e-mail address, and/or having the same phone number.

  
We allow consultants/friends to help their clients/friends sign up (sometimes people will sign up next to each other to make sure they click the right link). We do not allow John Doe's Marketing Agency to sign up using John Doe's link (that was an example).

  
If you do not believe this is the case open a support ticket with us! Be sure to include your affiliate email and your referral link and title the ticket relating to this affiliate portal issue so we can be sure to see this and look into this asap!

## **Certificate of No US Activities**

  
In rare cases, your payments may be affected due to a Certificate of No US Activities. In this instance, you should have received a relevant email titled "Certificate of No US Activities - Unpayable Affiliates" from the HighLevel team.   
  
To resolve this, please log into your HighLevel account, and click on the Affiliate Portal to access your dashboard. You may need to update your information within the portal.
