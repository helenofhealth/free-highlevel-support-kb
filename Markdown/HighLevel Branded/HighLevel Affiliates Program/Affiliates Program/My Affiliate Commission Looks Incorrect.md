Does your commission amount look different from what you were expecting?
  
  
Here are a few potential causes:

* If HighLevel is running a promo, such as a Black Friday / Cyber Monday deal, usual commission amounts could be lower than normal.
* If the commission is the product of a referral upgrading their HighLevel plan, the commission amount will be prorated in accordance with the day of the upgrade.
* If your referred customer receives a refund from the HighLevel team, it will show up as a negative balance in your portal.  
   * Note: An overall negative balance does **not** mean you owe money, but you will need to generate enough commission to counteract the negative amount in order to receive a payout.
