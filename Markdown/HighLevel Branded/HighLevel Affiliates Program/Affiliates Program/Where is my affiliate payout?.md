**"The affiliate portal shows that I was paid, but I didn't receive the money."**

  
There could be a few reasons for this!

* Make sure you've set up **Tipalti**  
   * If you do not have an active HighLevel account, send an email to affiliatepayments@gohighlevel.com and request a Tipalti set-up link!  
   * If you do have an Active HighLevel subscription, you can set up Tipalti within your [Affiliate Portal](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/48001208136-affiliate-payouts-where-how-when-can-i-get-paid-).
* Are you past the **threshold of $50** in commission? Payouts are only released after you've generated more than $50, so see if you can bring on another referral this month!
* Payments are released between the **10th-15th** of each month, and may take up to 5 days to reach your bank account. If you've completed all other steps and haven't received your payout by the 20th of the month, reach out to our support team!
* Ensure that your promotion efforts abide by our [Affiliate Policy](https://www.gohighlevel.com/affiliate-policy)! If your payments have been suspended due to violations of the policy, you'll have multiple notices in your inbox.
