###   
**Can I give a 14-day trial to existing customers?**

A: No the 14-day trial is only for new customers.

  
###   

###   
**I have seen other affiliates give out a 30-day Extended Pro trial link. How can I get that link?**

A: The 30-Day trial offers are exclusively for high-performing affiliates. If you have 100 or more active customers and are interested in offering your referrals a 30-day trial, [reach out to an Affiliate Manager](https://speakwith.us/affiliate) to see if you qualify.
  
  
###   
**My customer was just charged for the Pro plan upon upgrading I thought this was a free trial?**

A: For existing HighLevel customers, upon filling out the upgrade form they will be immediately upgraded to the $497 plan in 1-3 business days and their billing date will be reset and charged the prorated amount.  
  
If you are a TOP affiliate they will also be upgraded and prorated for their current subscription but will receive all the features of pro for one month!  
  
This is noted on the upgrade form before customers submit it.
  
  
### **If the customer I am referring to Highlevel Pro is currently not assigned to an affiliate do I get 100% of their commission or just a portion?**

A: Since you did not refer this customer to Highlevel, you will only be getting a commission for their HighLevel Pro subscription and upgrade NOT the base subscription. Meaning if you referred a customer to upgrade from the 297 plan to the 497 Pro plan you would get 40% of the $200 difference of the upgrade every month they pay their subscription.
