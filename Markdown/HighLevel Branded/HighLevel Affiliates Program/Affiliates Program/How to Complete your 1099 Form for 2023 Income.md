As we approach tax season, we want to ensure a smooth process for everyone. Qualifying affiliates should have received an email from [Tax1099.com](http://Tax1099.com) to access your 1099 from HighLevel for the 2023 tax year.

  
The IRS requires us to send out 1099s prior to January 31st. This 1099 outlines the total amount you received from HighLevel in 2023 and is essential for your tax return.

  
You'll need to follow the directions provided in that email to be able to access it.
  
  
**What to do:**

  
**1\. Log In:** [Click here](https://www.tax1099.com/) to access the login page.

  
**2\. Enter Email ID:** Use the email address where you received the Tax1099.com email.

  
**3\. Password:** Refer to the Password Scenarios listed at the bottom of the login screen for the correct password.

  
Here's a sneak peek of what the email looks like so you can find it in your inbox:
