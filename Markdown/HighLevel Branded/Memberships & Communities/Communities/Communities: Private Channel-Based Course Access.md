# **What is Private Channel-Based Course Access?**

  
Private Channel-Based Course Access lets group admins restrict course visibility to members of specific private channels within their group. This allows you to curate a more personalized and secure learning experience by controlling exactly who can see and access individual courses.

  
Once a course is linked to a Private Channel, only members of that channel can view the course in the Learning section. Members who are not in the selected Private Channel(s) will not see the course at all unless they later gain access to the channel.

  
## **Key Benefits of Private Channel-Based Course Access**

  
Private Channel-Based Course Access empowers you to manage learning experiences with greater precision and flexibility.

* Offer premium courses to members of paid or subscription-based Private Channels.
* Run exclusive training programs for moderators or internal teams.
* Restrict visibility of internal or early-access content to select groups.
* Simplify content management by linking one course to multiple Private Channels.
* Maintain a clean Learning section—restricted courses are invisible to non-authorized members.
* Easily identify restricted courses with a **Private-channel based access** tag.

## **Private Channel Visibility Tag**

  
To make it easier for admins and owners to identify which courses are restricted, any course with Private Channel-Based Access will display a **Private-channel based access** tag in its listing.

  
This tag ensures transparency and helps you manage content access across multiple groups and courses efficiently.
