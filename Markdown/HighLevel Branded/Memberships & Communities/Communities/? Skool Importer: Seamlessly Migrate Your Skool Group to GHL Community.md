   * `firstName`  
   * `lastName`  
   * `email` _(may be missing for some members)_
2. Download the CSV and **fill in any missing email addresses**.

2. The system will:  
   * Automatically import valid members  
   * Display a count of successful and failed imports

### **Step 4: Migrate Posts**

## ❓FAQs

**Q: Can I retry importing failed members?**  
Yes! Just fix the CSV and click **Try Again**.

**Q: What happens if I change the profile slug?**  
Don't do it—the system uses that to identify members. Changing it can break the import.

**Q: Are posts imported for members not successfully added?**  
No. Posts are tied to member IDs, so only those successfully imported will have their posts brought over.
