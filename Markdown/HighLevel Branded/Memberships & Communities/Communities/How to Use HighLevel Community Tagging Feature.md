Engaging with your community members on the platform has just become easier! With our new tagging feature, users can mention specific members in both posts and comments. This not only fosters better engagement but also helps keep conversations organized. 

Here's how to effectively utilize this feature:

  
# **1\. Tagging in Posts:**

* **Start a Tag:** While drafting a post, simply type the "@" symbol followed by the initial characters of the member's name.
* **Selecting a Member:** As you type, a list of relevant members will be displayed, narrowed down based on the characters you've entered. Navigate to the desired name and click on it or use arrow keys to highlight it. When you hover over a name, it will appear highlighted in blue.
* **Inserting the Tag:** Once a member's name is selected, it will appear in your post content as a highlighted tag.
* **Publishing:** After crafting the post, hit publish. The members you've tagged will receive a notification, informing them of their mention in the post.

* **Publishing:** Once you're satisfied with your comment, proceed to publish it. Tagged members will receive notifications of their mentions.
* **Tagging in Comment Replies:** The tagging feature isn't restricted to new comments; you can also tag members in replies to existing comments.

  
# **3\. Email Notifications for Tags:**

* **Receiving Notifications:** If someone tags in a post or comment, Highlevel will send an email notification to alert you.
* **Direct Navigation:** Within this notification, you'll find a direct link to the post or comment where you've been tagged, ensuring you can seamlessly jump into the conversation.
