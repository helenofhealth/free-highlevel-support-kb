# **Invitation Flow**

Once the invitation is dispatched, the recipient will receive an email with the following behavior:

  
**Scenario A: User Has Never Signed Up or Is Not Part of the Client Portal**

* If the recipient has never signed up for the platform or is not part of the client portal, they will find an "Accept Invite" button in the email.
* Clicking this button will redirect them to a "Set Password" modal where they can create their account.

  
**Scenario B: User Is Already a Member with Login Credentials**

* If the recipient is already a member with login credentials, clicking the "Accept Invite" button will instantly redirect them to the Group using a magic link.

**Important Note:**

  
The invitation link included in the email will expire after 30 days for security reasons. Ensure that the recipient accepts the invitation within this timeframe.
