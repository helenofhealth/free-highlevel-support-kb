Creating a white-label community inside a GoHighLevel (GHL) subaccount involves customizing the community features to match your brand. Here’s a step-by-step guide:

### 1\. **Access the Subaccount in GoHighLevel**

* Log in to GoHighLevel.
* Navigate to the sub-account where you want to create the community.
* Head over to Membership > Communities

### 2\. **Set Up the Custom Domain (White-Labeling)**

* In **Community Settings** \> **Domains**, add a custom domain (or subdomain) to host the community (inside a client portal). For example, `community.yourdomain.com`.
* Follow the instructions to update your DNS settings to point to GoHighLevel’s servers. This will make your community fully white-labeled under your domain.
* Follow this link for brief on [what is a domain ](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/155000002561-setting-up-whitelabel-domain-api-domain-email-sending-domain-sites-domain-client-portal-domain-)
* Note: The domain settings would be for Client Portal since a community exists within a client portal
