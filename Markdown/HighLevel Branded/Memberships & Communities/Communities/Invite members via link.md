## Invited Members

For members who receive an invitation via an invite link, here's what to expect:

* **Step 1:** Click on the invite link you received.
* **Step 2:** A personalized pop-up modal will appear.

In this modal, you have the following options:

* **Option 1:** Sign up for a new account if you are not already a member.
* **Option 2:** Log in with your existing credentials if you are a registered member.
* **_Note_**: It's important to note that even when using invite links, the standard approval process still applies for private groups. This ensures that only approved members gain access to the group, maintaining its security and integrity.
