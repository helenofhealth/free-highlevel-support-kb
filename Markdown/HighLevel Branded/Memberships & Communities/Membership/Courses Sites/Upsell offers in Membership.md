# **What is One-Click Upsell in Memberships?**

  
A one-click upsell is a post-purchase offer that appears immediately after a customer buys a product. Instead of going through another full checkout process, customers can accept the additional offer with just a single click, and the same payment method is used automatically. This technique helps businesses increase order value without adding friction to the buying process. It’s especially useful for selling related digital products, bonuses, or access to premium content.

* **Alignment**: Choose whether the title appears left-aligned, centered, or right-aligned.

**Preview and Activate**

  
Once your upsell page is fully customized, you can save changes, preview the final experience, and activate the upsell offer for live use. These controls are located in the top-right corner of the editor.

  
* **Save**: Click the **Save** button to apply any edits or customizations you’ve made to the upsell page. Saving ensures that your changes are preserved before activating the offer.
* **Preview**: Use the **Preview** option to view the upsell experience exactly as your customers will see it. This is helpful for reviewing layout, messaging, and checkout flow before publishing.
* **Activate/Deactivate Toggle**: The dropdown that says **Inactive** allows you to change the upsell’s status. Select **Active** to make the upsell live and available to customers during the checkout process. You can also toggle it back to **Inactive** if you want to pause the upsell offer without deleting it.
