## **How to Configure Your Product and Attach a Course Offer**

  
Follow these steps to create a new product and link it with a course offer.

  
### **Step 1:** Access the Product Creation Page

  
To get started with creating a new product, navigate to the **Payments** section from the left-hand menu of your dashboard. Then, hover over the **Products** dropdown in the top menu and click on **Products** from the list. This will take you to the product management page where all your existing products are listed. From here, click on the blue **\+ Create Product** button located in the top right corner of the screen to begin setting up a new product. This action will open the product creation interface, where you’ll enter key details like product name, pricing, and membership configuration.

### **Step 2:** Fill in Product Information

  
The **Product Information** section is where you define the foundational details for your product. First, the **“Include in Online Store”** toggle allows you to determine whether this product should be visible and available for purchase through your online storefront. If you want your product to be publicly available, this toggle must remain enabled.

  
Next, the **Title** field is a required input where you name your product—this will be shown across your checkout, internal views, and potentially public listings. Below that, the **Description** field allows you to provide a detailed overview of the product, using rich text formatting options such as bold, italics, links, bullet points, and font customization to enhance readability and appeal.

  
The **Media** section lets you upload an image or video file to visually represent your product. This helps users quickly recognize what they’re buying. It’s recommended to upload files with a resolution of 1024×1024 and a size not exceeding 10MB for optimal display and performance.

  
There is also an **Enable Product Label** checkbox. If enabled, you can assign a custom label (e.g., “New,” “Top Pick,” etc.) to the product which may be used for visual badges or internal organization.

  
Lastly, the **Product Collection** dropdown lets you assign this product to an existing collection. Collections help group similar products together for better organization and presentation, especially when managing a larger catalog.

### **Step 3:** Configure Tax Options

  
The **Product Information** section includes several key fields to define how the product is presented and taxed. One of the first elements here is the **Product Tax Code**, which allows you to select a specific tax category for your product. This is important for enabling automatic tax calculations during checkout. If left blank, the system will apply your default global tax settings.

  
Next, the **Include tax in prices** option gives you control over whether your product pricing should be shown as tax-inclusive or tax-exclusive. You can either follow the global setting or manually choose “Yes” to include tax in the displayed price or “No” to show it as a separate charge.

  
Additionally, there’s an option to **Attach Tax Rates**, which is useful if you’re handling taxes manually or have buyers outside the U.S.

  
Finally, the **Statement Descriptor** field allows you to override the default account name that appears on a customer’s bank statement. This ensures clarity for the buyer and can help reduce payment disputes or confusion.

### **Step 4:** Set Pricing

  
In the **Pricing** section of the product setup, users can define how their product will be offered to customers by configuring a range of pricing-related fields. Start by entering a **Pricing Name**, which serves as an internal label to help distinguish between different pricing options if you’re offering multiple tiers or plans. Next, select the **Type** of pricing from the dropdown—either **Onetime**, which charges the customer a single fee, or **Recurring**, which adds options for billing cycles, trial periods, and setup fees. In the **Amount** field, input the exact price you want to charge for the product. You can optionally enter a **Compare-at Price**, which is useful for showing discounted pricing by displaying the original price next to the actual price being charged. Below this, use the **Currency** selector to define which currency the payment will be made in, such as USD. If inventory tracking is relevant, check the **Track Inventory** box to manage stock levels and input available quantities. Clicking on **Additional Options** reveals more advanced pricing settings like purchase limits or metadata fields. Use the **Price Description** field to add a brief note or context for this pricing entry (visible internally).

### **Step 5:** Link the Product to a Membership Offer

  
After configuring your product price, you must **toggle on the “Membership Offer” option** to activate access linking. Once the toggle is enabled, a **“Select Membership Offer”** dropdown will appear. From this dropdown, choose the published membership offer that should be granted when someone purchases this product. Only **published offers** will appear in this list—if the offer hasn’t been published yet, it won’t be selectable. This step is essential, as it ensures that after payment is completed, the user is automatically enrolled in the correct course or training bundle associated with the offer. Without enabling this setting and selecting an offer, users won’t be granted access to the membership content even if they complete their purchase.

**Important:** 
  
Before creating a product, make sure your membership offer has already been created and published. Only published offers will appear in the “Membership Offer” dropdown when setting up your product. If your offer is still in draft, it will not be selectable during product setup.   
  
**How to Create a Course Offer** 
  
Go to the Memberships tab. Click the dropdown and select **Offers.** Click **+ Create Offer**. Add a title, select your course(s), set the price, and hit Create. Publish the offer.

### **Step 6:** Add Product Variants

  
The “Variants” section lets you create different versions of a product, such as multiple pricing tiers, content levels, or access durations. To set this up, you first add an **Option name** like “Course Level” or “Access Plan.” Then, under **Option values**, you input the specific variants (e.g., “Basic,” “Premium,” “Pro”) and click **Done**. Each variant can have its own **price**, **compare-at price**, and **available quantity**, making it easy to manage inventory and pricing for each option. You can also enable **Track Inventory** if you want to limit how many of each variant can be sold. This is especially useful when offering bundles or time-limited enrollment.

### **Step 7:** Optimize Search Engine Settings

  
The **Search Engine Listing** section helps optimize your product for search engines and improves its discoverability online. In the **SEO Title** field, you can enter a concise and relevant title that clearly identifies the product and includes keywords users might search for. The **SEO Description** allows you to provide a brief summary of the product that also incorporates relevant keywords, enhancing visibility in search results. Lastly, the **Handle** defines the product’s unique URL slug (e.g., /product/my-course-name), which can be customized to make the link more readable and SEO-friendly. This section is optional but highly recommended for improving online reach.

### **Step 8:** Save Your Product

  
Click the **Save** button in the bottom-right corner. Once saved, users who purchase this product will automatically gain access to the attached course offer.
