## **What is a Magic link in Memberships?**

  
The magic link is designed to side-step having to use a username and password to log in. Once logged in, clients will see whatever "products" you/they have been granted access to. It is meant to give clients access only to the products they have been granted access to.

  
**Please Note:**

**If you’re using the magic link while logged in as your agency admin account, you’ll see all the available courses for that sub account.** 

##   

Membership sites can be great for sharing valuable content with your customers or users. However, sometimes logging in can be a hassle, especially if someone forgets their password. That's where Membership magic links come in. These one-click links allow your clients to quickly and easily access your courses without remembering their usernames or password. Whether sending out the link via email or using it as a custom menu link, Membership magic links make it easy to grant access to your courses to those who need it. Just be sure only to share the link with those granted access to your content.

Magic Link can expire If you generate a new one. Older ones will be invalid.

It doesn't work for contacts who don't have a membership offer granted to them.

### **When testing, when I click on a magic link, it shows all the courses the contact should not have access to.**

This is an Agency Admin privilege; when you click on a Magic Link being an Agency admin, it auto logs you in as someone with access to all courses. If you want to do some testing, try opening a magic link in incognito.
