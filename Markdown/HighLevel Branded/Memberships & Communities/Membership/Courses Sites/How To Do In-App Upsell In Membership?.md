# **What is In-App Upsell**

  
An In-App Upsell allows you to display additional offers directly within the My Library page of a membership product. When learners log in, they’ll see locked products or course bundles they can choose to purchase separately. This seamless integration lets you cross-sell without disrupting the user’s experience or requiring a separate sales page.

## **Frequently Asked Questions**
