## **Best Practices:**

* To optimize your experience, it's recommended to refrain from using custom CSS.
* Create a backup of your themes. This precautionary step allows you to revert to your original settings if needed.
* Initiate the migration during off-hours to minimize any potential impact on your learners while using the course.

## **Steps to import course**

Follow these steps to import your courses:

### **Step 1: Create a Learner profile**

* Create a learner profile on the platform you are importing from  
   * Ensure you are creating a new contact within the platform you are importing from
* Once created, go back to the Course Importer screen and enter the email and password you used to create the account in the previous step.
* Add the learner domain in the domain field (the domain where you enter learner login credentials).
* Click the "Import" button

### **Step 2: Importing process**

* Once the import process has started, it will log you in via learner credentials and start importing the courses.
* While progress will be shown, make sure to click the "Refresh" button to get an accurate status.
* To cancel the importing process, click the "Cancel" button.
* Tabs can be switched while importing, but do not close the tab or window.
* All videos, images and text content will be migrated for courses (and lessons).

  
Note: The import will only bring in lessons that have been published. Additionally, the assignments, quizzes, and assessments will not be included in the import process.  
  
**The preferred themes for the Library and Product sections are Encore Site and Premier Product, respectively.**

## **FAQs**

* **What causes an authentication error?**

Authentication errors appear when the added domain or credentials are incorrect. To resolve this, carefully verify the credentials again and ensure they are correct before initiating the import process.

* **What causes a "course import failed" error** **?**  
    
Possible reasons for import failure:  
   * **Incorrect Theme:** Ensure that the selected theme is correct.  
   * **Credential Verification:** Double-check the accuracy of the provided credentials.  
   * **Valid Domain:** Confirm that the provided domain is compatible with the "/login" path. For example, "domainName/login" should lead to the login page.  
   * **Retry Option:** If the import fails, users can click on "retry" to resume the process from where it left off.  
   * **Cancellation Clarification:** If a user cancels the import, it will be considered as canceled by the user, and any new imports will start from the beginning.
