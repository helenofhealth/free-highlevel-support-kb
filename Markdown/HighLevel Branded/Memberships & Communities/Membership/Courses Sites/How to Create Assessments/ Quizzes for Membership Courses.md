### **Assignment Editor: Upload Instructions and Templates**

  
Once you’ve clicked the small pencil icon (Edit Button), you’ll be directed to the assignment editor where you can configure the content and settings. Start by giving your assignment a **title**, which will be displayed to learners. If the assignment doesn’t require grading, you can enable the **Ungraded Assignment** checkbox to allow submissions without evaluation. You can upload a **thumbnail image** to visually represent the assignment—this is especially helpful for branding or content recognition.

  
In the **Instructions** section, add clear guidance to help learners understand what is expected in their submission. Use formatting tools to emphasize important information or include hyperlinks to relevant resources. The **Upload Templates** area allows you to upload supporting documents or starter files (.docx, .pdf, .pptx, etc.) that students can use to complete the assignment. Finally, use the **Confirmation Message** field to customize the message learners see after submitting their work. This can be a motivational note, next steps, or simply a thank-you message to reinforce the completion. These tools work together to create a more engaging and informative assignment experience within your membership product.

### **Quiz Editor: Setup and Customization Options**

  
After selecting **Quiz** as the assessment type, you’ll be taken to the **quiz configuration editor**, where you can build and customize the entire quiz experience. Begin by entering a **Quiz Title**, which will be visible to learners. If you want to assess learner performance, enable the checkbox for **“This quiz requires passing grade”** and enter the required **Passing Grade** percentage to define what qualifies as a successful completion.

  
You can enhance the quiz visually by uploading a **Quiz Thumbnail** image—this gives learners a branded or themed visual cue for the quiz. Below that, use the **Pass Confirmation Message** and **Fail Confirmation Message** fields to write personalized feedback that learners will see based on their performance. These editors support text formatting, links, and embedded content, so you can include detailed guidance, encouragement, or even resource links.

  
Once the setup is complete, click on the **Add Question** button to begin building your quiz. You can add multiple types of questions—single-choice or multiple-choice—and configure each with correct answers and optional explanations. This editor controls both the learner interface and how performance is tracked, making it a crucial step in designing effective assessments for your course.

## **What Happens When Someone Submits a Quiz?**

  
Understanding the post-submission behavior helps you manage the learner experience. Based on how the quiz is configured, learners will receive different feedback.

  
**If Passing Grade is enabled:** Learners see their score, which answers were correct/incorrect—but not the correct answer itself.

  
**If Passing Grade is disabled:** They will also see the correct answer and any explanations added.

  
Learners can review their previous submission and retake the quiz if needed. This helps reinforce learning or improve performance.

## **How to Analyze Assessment Results**

  
The Assessments Analytics feature lets you track performance across all submissions. You can identify learning gaps, high performers, and engagement trends.

Go to Memberships > Analytics > Assessments

Filter by Product or Result (Passed/Failed)

Click the eye icon to view individual answers and scores
