## **Managing Notification Preferences** 

  
The Client Portal includes robust notification controls that allow both individual users and portal owners to manage how and when alerts are delivered. These settings help users stay informed while minimizing unnecessary notifications. Notifications can be delivered by email or push (for mobile app users), and preferences can be customized per event type.

  
## **Notification Options for Individual Users**

  
Users now have full control over whether they receive email or push notifications for specific types of events. This helps create a personalized experience that avoids notification fatigue while still ensuring important updates are seen.

  
Users can independently enable or disable email and push notifications for the following event types:

 • Community updates

 • Course certificates

 • Likes on posts

 • Likes on comments

  
All preferences can be accessed through the **Manage Your Account** section of the Client Portal.

  
## **Notification Controls for Portal Owners**

  
Portal owners can also configure certain notification defaults, specifically around engagement signals like likes. These settings apply across the entire portal and may override individual preferences in some cases.

  
Owner-controlled settings include:

 • Enabling or disabling email notifications for post likes

 • Enabling or disabling email notifications for comment likes

  
When a notification setting is locked by the portal owner, the user will see a tooltip explaining that the option is managed by the administrator.

  
## **How to Manage Your Notification Preferences**

  
Users can manage their own notification preferences by following these steps:

 1\. Navigate to the **Client Portal**, **Communities**, or **Courses** area.

 2\. Click your **profile icon** in the upper-right corner.

 3\. Select **Manage Your Account** from the dropdown menu.

 4\. Choose **Notifications** from the left-hand menu.

 5\. Use the toggle switches to turn **email** or **push** notifications on or off for each event type.

  
## **Benefits of Notification Customization**

  
**Greater Personalization**

Users can tailor their notification preferences to reduce inbox clutter and avoid unnecessary alerts.

  
**Push Notification Support**

Push notifications can now be independently managed in addition to email, giving mobile users more flexibility.

  
**Engagement Awareness**

Users can receive alerts when their content receives likes, helping them stay connected to the community.

  
**Simplified User Experience**

Clear tooltips indicate when a notification setting is controlled by the portal owner, reducing confusion and support issues.
