# **What Are SSO Magic Links?**

  
SSO Magic Links are unique, authenticated URLs that allow users to directly access a client portal app without entering login credentials. When a client clicks their personalized link, they’re instantly logged in and taken to the correct destination—whether it’s a course dashboard, community area, or affiliate portal.

  
These links are app-specific and contact-specific, meaning each user receives secure access to the exact portal experience they’ve been granted.
