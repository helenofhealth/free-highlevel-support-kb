### Enabling/Disabling Apps

* **Review Available Apps**: Within the App Permissions section, you'll see a list of all available apps and features associated with your portal.
* **Toggle Permissions**: Use the toggle switch next to each app to enable or disable it. Disabling an app will remove its functionality and visibility from your client portal interface.
