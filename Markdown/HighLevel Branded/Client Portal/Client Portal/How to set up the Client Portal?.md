## **What is the Client Portal?**

The client portal is a client-side interface located on the subdomain clientclub.net. It's a centralized platform designed to allow clients and leads to interact with their respective sub-accounts in a streamlined manner.![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155001303871/original/rp92ZFYpGylrXy4YqM0xx7AiGLjp2gjPxw.png?1687171974)

  
**Centralized Platform:** The portal is a hub where clients can access their affiliate commissions, participate in community (upcoming) groups (**upcoming)**, and enroll in membership courses. Having all of these functionalities in one place makes it easy for clients to manage their interactions with your business and services.

  
**Custom Domains:** The portal offers the flexibility to set up a custom domain for each sub-account for a more personalized touch. This feature enhances the client's sense of ownership and can increase their engagement with your service.

  
**Brandable Interface:** The portal can be customized to reflect each sub-accounts brand identity. By setting up their preferred logo, favicon, color scheme, and more, sub-accounts can provide a consistent and familiar experience to their leads and clients.

  
**Improved Communication and Client Autonomy:** The portal facilitates easy and secure communication between you and your clients. Moreover, it empowers your clients by allowing them to take necessary actions independently. This level of autonomy can lead to increased client satisfaction and retention.

  
**Easy Invitation:** The client portal provides easy ways to invite clients through child apps or by sharing the portal URL directly.

  
### **What are some strong usage cases for this feature?**

**1\. Online Education Business (E-Learning Platforms):** If a business offers a variety of online courses across different subjects, the client portal allows students (clients) to access their courses, track their progress, and interact with other students in the community (upcoming) groups. It simplifies the learning process and fosters a sense of community (upcoming) among students.

  
**2\. Software as a Service (SaaS) Companies: For a SaaS company with an affiliate marketing program, the client portal provides affiliates with a single platform to monito**r their referrals and commissions. This transparency can motivate affiliates to promote the software more enthusiastically.

  
**3\. Fitness Industry (Online Training Programs):** If a fitness business offers different online training programs, the client portal can be used for members to access their specific workout plans, participate in fitness communities, and view their progress over time.

  
**4\. Marketing Agencies:** For a marketing agency that manages several clients (each being a sub-account), each client could have their custom domain in the client portal. This allows the clients to feel more ownership over their data and campaigns and streamlines the communication process between the agency and its clients.

  
**5\. Retail E-commerce Businesses:** An e-commerce business can use the client portal to invite loyal customers to a VIP program. The customers can log in to view exclusive offers, track their points or rewards, and participate in special community (upcoming) events.

### **What are some benefits of this feature?**

Streamlined Access to Information:** By centralizing all key functions and data (like affiliate commissions, community (upcoming) groups, and membership courses) in one place, clients can easily find and access the information they need without navigating through multiple platforms or interfaces.

  
**2\. Improved Client Autonomy:** Clients have the flexibility and power to take action independently. This can lead to increased satisfaction as clients can solve problems or answer their questions without needing to reach out for support.

**6\. Increased Credibility with Custom Domains:** A custom domain not only gives clients a sense of ownership and familiarity but also increases the credibility of the sub-account in the eyes of the clients.

  
**7\. Efficient Communication:** With a client portal, communication with clients becomes more efficient as you can reach them all in one place, and they can access and respond to the communication at their convenience.

## **How to set up your client portal?**

We have implemented a robust client portal system for each sub-account on our dedicated subdomain, clientclub.net. This portal facilitates effective interaction between clients and their associated accounts. However, during the setup process, we offer a flexible feature for each sub-account to personalize its portal by selecting a unique custom domain. This customization allows sub-accounts to reinforce their branding and enhance their client's familiarity with the platform.

  
### **Configuring a custom Domain:**

To configure a custom domain for your client portal, follow these steps:

1. Using the left sidebar, navigate to the **Sites** tab then the **Client Portal** section. Proceed to the **"Domain Setup."** area.![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155001322192/original/Td94GZjenSgFsO6IoEZOtqujmsbtrR8kaQ.png?1687182770)
2. Click on the option for a Custom domain and input your desired domain name. ![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155001323808/original/waKWI4CeOu8GF9ko2JYH4yVoTGab3L396g.png?1687183733)

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155002194248/original/1b4YH1UUv--g7Fug1T-aYWO4HMOYtsK5bQ.png?1688403807)

  
Before you can successfully set up an A or CNAME record, you must ensure that you have already configured your domain registrar to point to the specific IP address or server provided to you. This is an essential step in ensuring that your domain correctly refers to your server, enabling it to function properly.

A Record, also known as an Address Record, maps your domain to an individual server IP address. On the other hand, a CNAME record, or Canonical Name record, is used to map your domain (or subdomain) to another domain name.

Here's a step-by-step guide on how to add A records and CNAME records:

* Login to your Domain Registrar's dashboard.
* Navigate to the DNS settings.
* Here, you will find an option to add a new record.
* Select the type of record you want to add (A or CNAME).
* Enter the details - for an A record, this would be the IP address **34.67.19.69**
* ; for a CNAME record, this would be the target domain **preview.clientclub.net**
* Save your changes.

  
Different registrars might have slight variations in the procedure, so here are some specific guides for popular registrars:

[NameCheap](https://www.namecheap.com/support/knowledgebase/article.aspx/319/2237/how-can-i-set-up-an-a-address-record-for-my-domain/)

[Bluehost](https://www.bluehost.com/help/article/dns-management-adding-an-a-record)

[HostGator](https://www.hostgator.com/help/article/how-to-manage-dns-records)

[Google Domains](https://support.google.com/domains/answer/3290350)
  
  
**Please note:**

It's important to replace the "designated IP address or server" placeholder with your actual IP address or server information in the record. Make sure to fill out this field accurately, as it's essential to correctly configure your domain settings.

  
Once you have entered the DNS records in your Domain registrar, give it a reasonable time to propagate them (depending on your domain registrar), and hit **Update Domain.**

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155002194359/original/U4mvBT_4NGPmvVWz7o4MuO9Ngqxz9gW3bQ.png?1688403918)

**Please note:**

While the following resources provide a good general overview, the exact time of DNS propagation can vary due to several factors, such as the TTL set for the DNS record, your ISP's update frequency, and geographical factors. Typically, it is suggested to allow between 24 to 48 hours for DNS propagation.

## **Invite Clients to your client portal.**

  
Inviting clients to your client portal enhances their experience with your services and fosters a sense of community (upcoming). The client portal serves as a central location for your clients to access important information, updates, and resources pertinent to the services they've availed of from your business. There are two primary methods to invite your clients to the portal:

  
### **Direct Invitation from Child Applications**

Your portal includes various child applications or services, such as a membership course, community (upcoming) platform, affiliate program, etc. You can extend invitations directly from these specific applications.

  
**Membership Course:** Existing membership users will have dual accessibility - they can access courses through the traditional method as well as through the client portal upon login. Their current username and password will function in both locations. For those locations with no existing courses, they will need to set up directly in the client portal.

  
**Community Platform:** (Upcoming)

  
**Affiliate Program:** You can extend an invitation from the affiliate management system for your affiliates. Head to Marketing> Affiliate Manager> Campaigns> Edit Campaign.

**Sharing the Client Portal URL**

  
If you want to take a more direct approach or invite a large number of clients at once, you can share the URL of your client portal. You can easily copy this URL from the domain setup section of your client portal's settings.![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155001319106/original/_99A6KgauydPRZ4sAlQsshsFoatrEZ3VVg.png?1687181017)

  
Once copied, this URL can be shared via email, text message, or any other communication channels you use to interact with your clients.

  
You might consider incorporating this URL into a welcome email or newsletter for new clients or posting it in an announcement on your main website or social media platforms.

  
Remember, your client portal is a hub for all your services. So, when sharing the URL, make sure to highlight the benefits and resources clients will gain by accessing the portal. This could include exclusive content, direct support channels, access to community (upcoming) discussions, and more.
