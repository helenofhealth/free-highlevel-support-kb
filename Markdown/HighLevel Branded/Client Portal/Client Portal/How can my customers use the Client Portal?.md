## **How can my customers use the Client Portal?**

### **Signup process**  
  
#### **Step 1: Who needs to go through the Client Portal Signup?**

  
Clients only need to sign up for the Client Portal if they cannot access child apps (Membership Courses, Affiliate Manager, **Communities>** **Upcoming**).

If they have been granted access to child apps before, they can log in to the Client Portal directly, thus skipping the redundant sign-up process. They can use the same credentials they have for their Membership portal to log in to the Client Portal.  
  
**Please Note:** 

This is designed to streamline the user experience and prevent the need for multiple registrations.

  
#### **Step 2: Account Creation & CRM Restrictions**

  
Clients can sign up multiple times with the same email address if your Business Profile Settings permit duplicate contacts. Each registration creates a distinct user account. ![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155001373478/original/9hNOZyipTNiZgda5grayaRcSRi6cKKShRQ.png?1687251157)
  
  
If the CRM does not allow duplicate contacts, clients cannot sign up more than once with the same email. The system will prevent creating multiple user accounts linked to one email address to uphold data integrity and avoid confusion or data duplication.

**Please Note:** 

Know your CRM settings and their implications on client account creation for the Client Portal.

  
### **Step 3: Registration Process**

  
To register for the Client Portal, clients must provide their full name and email address and choose a password.![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155001373833/original/fPDRPuSLl9A0kz0JWAbtiEk7iL5RhzGC2A.png?1687251362)

  
After they submit these registration details, the system will send a verification code to the provided email address.

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155001374081/original/aaHb9tejxIo7aWCIYopHrqMB9GvyQsRuzA.png?1687251486)

**Please Note:** 

Ensure the clients know to check their email (including spam/junk folders) for the verification code. The Verification codes expire after 15 minutes.

  
#### **Step 4: Account Verification**

  
Clients must enter the verification code sent to their email address to authenticate their account.![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155001374201/original/utZ765KAlXfGD_vDjCxGKwD3NWTdFM2dZA.png?1687251560)

After successful verification, they can log in to the client portal using their selected password during registration.

**Please Note:** 

The verification process is critical for maintaining the security and authenticity of client accounts.

### **Login**

Clients can access the client portal by logging in using one of two methods:

  
**Password Login:** Clients who already have a password can use it to log in directly to the client portal.

  
**Email Verification**: Alternatively, clients can authenticate their identity using a secure code sent to their registered email address. Upon selecting this method, an email containing a unique, time-limited secure code is sent to the client. This code must be entered on the login page to verify the client's identity and grant access to the client portal.

When multiple accounts are associated with the same email ID, the system provides an extra layer of functionality to ensure the correct account is accessed. When attempting to log in, the system will prompt the user to select from a list of user accounts associated with that email ID. This avoids confusion and helps ensure that clients access the correct account.![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155001375932/original/BTBILfORaHuC87gK_T-gzjp6Zgwu05wBzw.png?1687252474)
