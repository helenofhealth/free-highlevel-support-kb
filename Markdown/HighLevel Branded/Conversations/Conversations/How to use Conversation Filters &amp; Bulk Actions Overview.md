# **What Are Conversation Filters?**

  
Conversation Filters are a powerful feature that helps users organize and streamline their communication workflow. By allowing you to categorize and locate conversations based on specific criteria such as message type, assignee, or date, filters make it easy to prioritize and manage interactions efficiently. They enable you to stay organized, respond promptly, and manage your communication channels with ease.

  
Filters help you quickly find specific conversations by:

  
* **Contact Engagement Score**
* **Assigned** (specific team member)
* **Follower Assignment**
* **Last Message Channel/Type/Direction** (e.g., inbound/outbound)
* **Last Outbound Message Type** (e.g., manual/automated)
* **Last Message Channel** (e.g., SMS, Email)
