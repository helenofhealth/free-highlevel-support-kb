# **What is Live Chat?**

  
Live Chat inside Conversations is a powerful tool that allows businesses to engage with website visitors in real-time, providing instant support and fostering stronger customer relationships. Unlike traditional email or SMS-based communication, Live Chat ensures immediate responses, reducing wait times and improving customer satisfaction. Messages from the website chat widget are routed directly to the Conversations section, where users can manage interactions alongside other communication channels like SMS and email. This centralization helps streamline workflows, eliminating the need to switch between multiple platforms. Additionally, businesses can assign chats to specific team members, use automation to enhance efficiency, and configure fallback messages for unattended inquiries. With Live Chat, businesses can offer a seamless, interactive experience that keeps visitors engaged and increases conversion rates.
