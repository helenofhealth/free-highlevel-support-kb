**Access:** 

  
* Users with only assigned data access can create and view groups that include only contacts assigned to them.
* If a user has access to the phone number used to create the group chat, they can send messages within the group. Admins have access to all numbers added in the location, while users have access to the default number, numbers assigned to them, and all unassigned numbers.

  
**Note**: 

* Once a group is created, you cannot change the participants or the business phone number you selected to create the group chat.
* If a contact already in the group is deleted from your CRM, group messages will still be sent to the phone number that was originally added. Even if the contact's number is modified in the CRM, the messages will continue to go to the initially added number.
* If a contact in the group enables DND (Do Not Disturb) after the group chat is created, you will no longer be able to use the group chat. To continue group messaging, you will need to create a new group excluding the participant who is marked as DND.
