# **What Are Attachments?**

  
Attachments allow users to send and receive files within Conversations, making it easy to share important documents, images, or videos with clients. In HighLevel, attachments can be uploaded directly from a device or selected from the media library. Files too large for SMS or exceeding the 20MB email limit are automatically uploaded to the media library and shared as links. This ensures smooth delivery without file size restrictions.

### **Choosing an Upload Method**

### **Automatic Media Library Uploads**

  
If an SMS attachment or an email attachment larger than 20MB is uploaded, the system will automatically move the file to the media library.

Instead of attaching the file directly, a media library link will be inserted into the message, ensuring smooth delivery without size restrictions.

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

  
**Q: What types of files can be uploaded as attachments?**

Users can upload images, documents, PDFs, and videos as attachments. However, email attachments are limited to 20MB, and larger files will be automatically moved to the media library and shared as a link.

  
**Q: How can I access my uploaded files in the media library?**

All uploaded files are automatically stored in the media library, accessible from the Conversations interface. This allows users to reuse previously uploaded files without needing to reattach them manually.

  
**Q: What happens if I try to send an attachment that exceeds the email size limit?**

If an attachment exceeds 20MB, it is automatically uploaded to the media library and a link to the file is inserted into the email. This ensures that large files can still be shared without delivery issues.

  
**Q: Can I send attachments via SMS?**

Yes, attachments can be sent via SMS, but since SMS has size limitations, files are automatically converted into media library links for smooth delivery.

  
**Q: How do interactive video thumbnails work?**

When a video is uploaded through the media library, HighLevel automatically creates a GIF thumbnail preview. This enhances engagement by making emails more visually appealing and encouraging recipients to interact with the video content.
