## **What is the CC and BCC capability in the Email Composer?**

The CC (Carbon Copy) and BCC (Blind Carbon Copy) capabilities in the Email Composer enable you to send emails to additional recipients.

  
The CC function allows you to email additional recipients beyond the primary ones in the 'To' field. When you use the CC function, the email addresses of all recipients (primary and CC'd) are visible to all who receive the message.

  
On the other hand, the BCC function also allows you to send emails to additional recipients, but in a more private manner. When you use the BCC function, the email addresses of the BCC'd recipients are hidden from all other recipients. This means that people who receive the email will not know that the BCC'd recipients are also receiving it, thus ensuring their privacy.

  
### **Usage Cases:**

**Project Updates:** If a team is working on a project and the project manager wants to send an update to the team members and keep higher management or other departments in the loop, they can use the CC function. The team members would be in the 'To' field, and the higher management or other departments would be in the 'CC' field. This ensures that everyone has the same information about the project's progress.

  
**Customer Communication:** In customer service situations, the support representative might be communicating directly with a customer (the 'To' field), but they might also CC their manager or another team (like the technical team) if they want to keep them informed or require their input on the conversation.

  
**Confidential Matters:** If a manager wants to email a staff member but also wants to inform the HR department without the staff member knowing, they could use BCC. The staff member's email would be in the 'To' field, and the HR department would be in the 'BCC' field. This way, the HR department stays informed about the communication without the staff member knowing.

  
**Mass Email without Revealing Addresses:** If a company wants to send out an announcement or newsletter to multiple recipients without each recipient seeing the others' email addresses (for privacy reasons), they could use the BCC field. This way, each recipient receives the email without seeing who else the email was sent to.

  
**Vendor Communication:** If a business communicates with various vendors or suppliers and needs to send a similar message to all, they can put the primary vendor in the 'To' field and CC the rest. This way, all vendors know about each other, promoting transparency, but the main communication is addressed to the primary vendor.

**Replying to Emails:** You can only do a "reply all" to any email with CC or BCC recipients. It's important to note that you cannot remove CC/BCC recipients in the middle of a thread.
