Exciting news! We've rolled out the capability to automatically retain unsent messages in Conversations, allowing you to resume your work seamlessly.

## **What’s New?**

* Unsent messages in Conversations are now automatically retained.
* If you begin typing a message and leave the screen before sending, your draft will be preserved and ready when you return.
* This means you won’t lose your progress and can pick up right where you left off without having to retype.
