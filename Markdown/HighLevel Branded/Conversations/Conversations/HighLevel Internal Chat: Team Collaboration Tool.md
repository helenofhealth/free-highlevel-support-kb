## **Overview**

  
Internal Chat allows users to communicate privately with their sub-account users within the Conversations module. This streamlines discussions and enhances internal collaboration. Unlike contact conversations, internal chats are visible only to participants, ensuring conversations remain private.

## **Inbox Overview**

  
Once you enable Internal Chat from Labs, a new Inbox panel appears on the left side of the Conversations interface. This panel includes two key inboxes that help organize and streamline communication:

  
###   **1\. Team Inbox**

 The Team Inbox displays conversations in the sub-account, based on your access level.

* Users with "Only Assigned Data" (e.g., Sub-account users) access will see all the conversations where they are either the contact owner or a follower.
* Users with "All Access" (e.g., Admins) will see all conversations in the sub-account.

This ensures that users only view conversations relevant to them, while admins maintain complete oversight.

###   
**2\.** **My Inbox**

My Inbox is a personalized space focused on conversations directly involving you. It contains the below folders:

* **Assigned to Me**: Lists all conversations where you are the contact owner, providing a clear view of interactions you are responsible for.
* **Internal Chat**: Shows internal-only conversation threads where you are a participant. These chats are private and designed for team collaboration, separate from customer-facing conversations.
