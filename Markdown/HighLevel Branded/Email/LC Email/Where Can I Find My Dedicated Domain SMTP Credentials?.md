## **Where can I find my IMAP settings?**

  
**IMAP is used to retrieve messages, and SMTP is for sending data**.

  
Note: Since we does not host mailboxes, We do not offer support for POP or IMAP protocols. In IMAP settings you cannot use the SMTP credentials.

You can find your IMAP in your email provider settings.

  
**Example:**

  
If you are using **Google**, you need to generate an app password in Google,

  
**Username**: Your Email address

**Password**: You app password  
**IMAP host:** imap.gmail.com  
**IMAP port:** 993

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

  
**Q: Why am I seeing the error “SMTP Credential creation is blocked. Please contact support…”?**

This message appears when your account has hit usage thresholds or restrictions on SMTP credential creation. This could be due to exceeding the daily email limit (e.g., 1,500 emails/day) or internal controls to prevent abuse. Please contact support to review your account status and request increased limits or to resolve any compliance flags.
