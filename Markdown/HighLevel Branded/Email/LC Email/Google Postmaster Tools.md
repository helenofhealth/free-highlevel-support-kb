## **Why Should You Use Google Postmaster Tools?**

  
Your sender reputation is crucial for ensuring your emails reach the inbox rather than being marked as spam. **Google Postmaster Tools** provides transparency into how Gmail rates your emails based on several factors:

  
* **Spam rates**: If too many users mark your emails as spam, it will affect your sender reputation.
* **IP & Domain reputation**: These metrics let you know if your sending infrastructure is considered trustworthy by Gmail.
* **Authentication success**: Tools like SPF, DKIM, and DMARC are essential to proving that your emails are legitimate. Postmaster Tools helps you monitor whether your authentication is passing.

  
By monitoring these metrics, you can proactively fix issues before they hurt your deliverability. If your email campaigns are not properly aligned with best practices, your emails might end up in the spam folder.
