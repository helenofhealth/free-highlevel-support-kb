LC Email is an "Email Service Provider", or the "engine" that powers email. It helps agencies avoid the hassle of signing up for Mailgun or another 3rd party email service provider external to the system. In the past, when an agency signed up, they would need to integrate with Mailgun or another email service provider to send/receive email. With LC Email, sending and receiving email works on every sub-account with very little setup required.

  
If you are looking to migrate over to **LC Email** please see the setup guide:[**how to Migrate over to LC Email**](https://help.gohighlevel.com/en/support/solutions/articles/48001222501).

## **What is LC Email?**

LC Email acts as an email service provider hosted by the CRM, which has industry-leading Deliverability, Error Monitoring, and Compliance so your emails are much more likely to be delivered. It's also considerably less expensive when compared to other email service providers in the market.

## **Why was this feature built?**

LC Email is designed to help agencies avoid the hassle of setting up and managing 3rd party email service providers like Mailgun or Sendgrid. 

  
As such, we built LC Email to work out-of-the-box with minimal setup and configuration required by an agency or a sub-account. In short, we wanted to provide an email service that "just works."

##   
**LC Email Pricing**

Pricing is **$0.675/1000 emails** for all the plans and the transactions will be detailed at the Agency Level:

## **Ramp-Up Model:**

  
Every new sub-account on the LC Email system follows a **Ramp-Up Model**, which gradually increases the daily sending limit to help build the sending reputation and avoid spam filters.

  
The email limits scale daily for the first seven days. Starting on the 8th day, the limit depends on whether you’re using a **shared IP** or a **dedicated IP** for sending:

  
| Day               | Email Limit                                    |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| 1                 | 250                                            |
| 2                 | 500                                            |
| 3                 | 1,000                                          |
| 4                 | 2,500                                          |
| 5                 | 5,000                                          |
| 6                 | 7,500                                          |
| 7                 | 10,000                                         |
| 8th Day & Ongoing | Shared domain: 150,00Dedicated domain: 450,000 |

  
**Please Note:**

The daily counter resets every day at midnight 00:00:01 AM UTC. If the limit is reached before the rest time, the account is locked for the rest of the period.

## **Extend Sending Limit:**

  
**Please note:** It's important to validate the sub-account activity and make sure it is not a spam account.

2\. The limit for Dedicated IP email sending is **250 to 450,000** (To increase this limit, please contact our support team)
