SSL certificates (Secure Sockets Layer) ensure that any links included in the email are secure and accessible by encrypting tracking URLs, open URLs, and click URLs in your emails. Without an SSL certificate, links in your emails will break, resulting in recipients encountering errors when trying to open them.

  
When a dedicated domain is added and verified in the email system, an SSL certificate is issued automatically. There are three possible SSL statuses for your domain:

1. **SSL Issued:** The SSL certificate has been successfully created.
2. **SSL Pending:** The SSL certificate is in the process of being generated.
3. **SSL Unknown:** The SSL certificate has not been generated or issued.
