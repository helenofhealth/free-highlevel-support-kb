LC - Email is designed to help agencies avoid the hassle of signing up for Mailgun or any 3rd party email service provider. In the past, when an agency signed up they would need to either integrate with Mailgun or another email service provider to send/receive emails.  
  
With LC - Email, sending & receiving email works right out of the box, on every subaccount. This article will help you migrate your Agency and sub-accounts over to the LC - Email.
