# **What is Email Verification**

  
When enabled, Email Verification happens automatically "behind the scenes". It can be set to re-verify every 90 days. It is a paid service and it significantly enhances the health of your email campaigns (by not sending emails to accounts that can't/won't interact with the email). This keeps your sending score high and improves your email delivery rate.

## **Enable Email Re-verification every 90 Days**

  
Since the quality of an email address can change, it is a good idea to re-verify previously verified email addresses regularly. That way you are not finding out they have gone bad after your email sending score is affected.

  
| **Step 1**: Navigate to Agency > Subaccounts and click on the 3 dot menu in the lower right corner of the Subaccount card > Manage Client | ![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155040226787/original/GYYxPDEUZlzGxEZLaEG2L9vd-8x2k7V53g.png?1737506220) |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Step 2**: Continue navigating to Advanced Settings > Advanced Email Settings and check or uncheck "Enable Re-verification for 90 days"  | ![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155040226804/original/3NDtG-FaLhZrJuPdH4PjCCRFJ9CVlIpwmg.png?1737506342) |

## **How Email Verification Works**

  
When Email Verification is activated, all email addresses will be verified before sending the first email, if it's not already verified. If Re-verification every 90 days is also active, the verification will expire after 90 days and the email address will be verified before sending another email.

  
You can manually check Email Verification on the Contact Details page.

  
| **Step 1**: Navigate to the Subaccount > Contacts section                               | ![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155040300160/original/SKALqJ_LL8rxLaZEnTLKDl0ezY0AIPcnaQ.png?1737596920) |

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

  
**What does Email Verification check for?**

Email Validation checks if the email is on a "bad" list at Mailgun. Furthermore, it checks:

* The email address syntax is correct.
* The domain is set up to receive email.
* The email address exists.
* The email address isn’t a high-risk address.
* The email address isn’t role-based, such as info@domain.com or admin@domain.com.

  
**Why is Email Verification important?**

Email Validation is important because it:

* Boosts your delivery rate by removing invalid email addresses.
* Maintains your mailing list hygiene by keeping your email list up-to-date.
* Improves your email marketing metrics like click-through rate (CTR), open rate, and click-to-open ratio (CTOR).
* Protects your sender's reputation.

  
**How does Email Verification impact my email deliverability?**

Email deliverability is highly impacted by bounced emails. Decrease email bounces by performing email verification ahead of time.

  
Your IP address and domain reputation take a hit when your email service provider (ESP) can’t place your email into a subscriber’s inbox. This impacts future deliverability because email clients rely on IP and sender reputations to determine whether or not to deliver your messages. If you have a bad sender or IP reputation, email clients may decide to place emails sent from your domain name in your subscriber’s spam folder. Or, they may not deliver them at all.

**Why does my sub-account have automatic email verification enabled?**

Sub-account has automatic email verification enabled because it was created within the last 30 days, and the deliverability rate of imported email list fell below 90%. This feature is designed to ensure the accuracy and deliverability of email addresses, helping to maintain high deliverability rates and effective emails.

  
**When should I verify my email list?**

If you’ve bought a mailing list (which we highly recommend that you don’t) or if you’ve inherited a mailing list you’re unfamiliar with. It’s a great idea to use an email verifier.

  
In addition, if your list has grown or it’s been some time since you last verified your email addresses, we recommend giving your mailing list a health check today.

  
**Where can I see my client's email usage?**

You can see the client's email usage by navigating to Agency Settings -> Billing -> See Details (under Credits).

  
**How can I bill my clients for usage?**

If you are on the Unlimited or Pro plan, you can rebill your clients and save the time & effort needed to bill them manually.
