## **What is this feature?**

Our innovative Risk Assessment feature is invaluable for your email marketing endeavors. It scrutinizes your imported contact list, providing a comprehensive overview of email deliverability and potential risks.

  
Delving into the specifics, it uses our internal Bulk Verification technology to dissect the email list, dividing addresses into categories such as 'deliverable,' 'undeliverable,' 'catch-all,' and 'unknown'. It further segments these categories by risk level: 'high', 'low,' 'medium,' and 'unknown'. This granular insight enables a clearer understanding of your contact list's deliverability prospects.

  
But it doesn't stop at merely providing data. It enhances your email strategy by helping reduce bounce rates and unnecessary blocks on your email-sending capabilities. It also prompts enabling the email verification feature for those not using it, further improving the overall success rate of your email campaigns.

  
In essence, this feature is your strategic partner in optimizing the deliverability and effectiveness of your email marketing campaigns, helping you reach your audience more consistently and efficiently.

### **Risk Categories**

  
| Risk Categories | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| High            | Email addresses falling into this category are highly likely to be undeliverable. This could be due to several reasons, such as the email account being non-existent, the domain not having any MX records, or the recipient's mailbox being full. |
| Medium          | Email addresses in this category may or may not be deliverable. This could be because the email server responded ambiguously, the domain was identified as a catch-all, or the email address was generated randomly.                               |
| Low             | Email addresses in this category are likely to be deliverable. This indicates the server responded positively to the verification request, and the email address appears properly structured and associated with a legitimate domain.              |
| Unknown         | Email addresses in this category could not be verified due to unforeseen errors or temporary issues with the recipient's email server. The deliverability of these emails remains uncertain unless re-verified later.                              |

### **Usage Cases:**

  
Bulk email verification is a powerful tool for businesses and organizations of all sizes, and it is used in several practical scenarios. Here are some examples:

  
**Email Marketing Campaigns:** Businesses regularly email marketing campaigns, sending newsletters, promotional emails, or updates to their customers. Using a list of unverified emails can lead to high bounce rates, negatively affecting the sender's reputation and deliverability. Bulk email verification helps businesses clean their email lists and ensure they reach their intended audience.

  
**User Registration Verification:** When users sign up for a service, they often provide an email address. However, they might make a typo, use an email address that doesn't exist, or provide a fake one. Bulk email verification can help to verify that these emails are valid before they are added to the company's database, ensuring that the company can communicate effectively with its users.

  
**CRM Data Cleaning:** Over time, email addresses in a company's Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system can become outdated. People may leave jobs, change their email addresses, or abandon old accounts. Regularly verifying these email addresses in bulk ensures the company's CRM data remains up to date.

  
**E-commerce Platforms:** Online retailers must communicate with customers about orders, shipping, and other related issues. Bulk email verification ensures that transactional emails (like order confirmations) and marketing emails reach the customers' inboxes.

  
**Community Updates:** Non-profit organizations, clubs, or communities often must send updates to their members. Bulk email verification ensures that these emails don't bounce back and the information reaches all intended recipients.

  
**Education Institutes:** Universities, colleges, and schools often communicate with students, parents, or staff through email. Whether it's fee updates, event announcements, or educational material distribution, these institutions must ensure that their emails are not sent to invalid addresses.

  
**Research and Surveys:** Many researchers and companies rely on email to distribute surveys and gather responses. They need to be sure that they're sending these critical communications to valid email addresses to get accurate and reliable data.

  
**Job Portals and Recruitment Companies:** They often communicate with job seekers and employers via email, sending job notifications, interview schedules, and more. Bulk email verification can help these companies maintain effective communication.

## **FAQs**

### **What does the Deliverable percentage in the Risk Assessment tab mean?**

The Deliverable percentage indicates the proportion of email addresses verified and found valid and reachable in a given job. This percentage is calculated by dividing the number of deliverable email addresses by the total number of email addresses in the job, then multiplying the result by 100.

  
### **How is the Undeliverable percentage calculated in the Risk Assessment tab?**

The Undeliverable percentage represents the proportion of email addresses in a specific job verified and found invalid or unreachable. This percentage is determined by dividing the number of undeliverable email addresses by the total number of email addresses in the job, then multiplying the result by 100.

  
### **What does the Unknown percentage in the Risk Assessment tab signify?**

The Unknown percentage shows the proportion of email addresses in a particular job that could not be definitively verified. This means that their deliverability status is unclear. It is calculated by dividing the number of emails with unknown status by the total number of emails in the job, then multiplying the result by 100.

  
### **What is the "Import Name" in the Risk Assessment tab?**

The "Import Name" is a unique identifier for each job or batch of email addresses you submit for verification. It allows you to track and manage each job separately.

  
### **Why might the date and time in the "Created at" column be important?**

The date and time information in the "Created at" column helps you understand when each email verification job was initiated. This can be particularly useful for tracking progress over time or determining the order in which jobs were processed.

  
### **Why isn’t every email verified?**

Not all email addresses can be verified for various reasons, such as server restrictions, privacy settings, or network issues. These email addresses are categorized as 'Unknown'.

  
### **What happens if the email server doesn't respond in time?**

If the email server doesn't respond in a timely manner, the verification system may categorize the email address as 'Unknown.' The system could not determine whether the email address is deliverable or undeliverable.

  
### **What do I do if I see many 'Unknown' email addresses in my list?**

Many 'Unknown' results might suggest server issues or other technical problems. You may want to consider re-running the verification process at a later time. If the problem persists, consider reaching out to Support. The formatting of the email address could be an issue, or the CSV format might have some problems.

  
### **What should be the next step after getting the Risk Assessment report?**

After receiving the Risk Assessment report, you should consider removing or re-checking the 'Undeliverable' and 'Unknown' email addresses from your list before executing any email campaign. This can help improve your campaign's deliverability rate and overall effectiveness.

  
### **What does "No. of Emails" mean in the Risk Assessment tab?**

The "No. of Emails" represents the total count of email addresses included in a particular batch or job for verification. This gives you an idea of the scale of the email verification job.

  
### **Why do different jobs/batches have different Deliverable, Undeliverable, and Unknown percentages?**

Different jobs or batches may have varying percentages of Deliverable, Undeliverable, and Unknown emails due to the quality of the email addresses in each batch. For instance, a batch containing older or outdated email addresses may have a higher Undeliverable percentage than a batch with recently collected addresses.

  
### **What can I do to improve the deliverability percentage?**

To improve deliverability, you can collect the email addresses through reliable sources, update your email lists regularly, and use double opt-in methods to ensure the email addresses belong to people genuinely interested in receiving your communication.

  
### **Why are some emails categorized as Deliverable, but they still bounce?**

Deliverable emails can still bounce due to the recipient's mailbox being full, the mail server being temporarily unavailable, or the email being marked as Spam by the recipient's email service.

  
### **Can I re-run the email verification for a specific batch?**

Yes, you can re-run the email verification for a specific batch. This could be particularly helpful in case a significant percentage of emails were marked as Unknown, which might be due to temporary server issues.

  
### **How often should I verify my email lists?**

The frequency of email list verification can depend on various factors like list growth, bounce rates, etc. However, it's a good practice to verify your email list before any significant email campaign.

  
### **How does the email verification process impact my overall email marketing strategy?**

Email verification is crucial for maintaining a healthy email marketing strategy. It helps you remove invalid or undeliverable emails, thus improving the deliverability rate, protecting your sender reputation, and increasing the effectiveness of your email campaigns.

  
### **Does the verification process respect user privacy?**

Yes, the email verification process respects user privacy. It doesn't involve accessing the contents of any email, but rather, it checks whether an email address is valid and capable of receiving emails.

  
### **Is the email verification process secure?**

Yes, the email verification process is designed to be secure. The data you submit for verification is typically processed over secure connections, and the resulting information is handled according to the service provider's data handling and privacy policies.
