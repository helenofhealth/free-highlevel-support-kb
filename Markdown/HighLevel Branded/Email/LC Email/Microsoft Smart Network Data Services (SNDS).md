1. **Filter Results**  
   * **Spam < 10%**: Your emails are largely bypassing spam filters. This is a good indicator of a healthy reputation.  
   * **10% spam or higher**: Some emails are being classified as spam. Check your sending practices, content, and lists to avoid deliverability issues.
2. **Blocked Status**  
   * **No**: Your IP is not blocked. It can send emails without restrictions.  
   * **Yes**: Your IP is blocked due to possible spam behavior or policy violations. Immediate steps are required to investigate the root cause and resolve the issue.
3. **Trap Hits**  
   * **0 Trap Hits**: Your IP is not interacting with spam traps. This is ideal for maintaining a clean sender reputation.  
   * **One or More Trap Hits**: Spam traps are receiving your emails. This suggests that your list may contain invalid or suspicious addresses. Clean your list to prevent further damage to your reputation.
4. **Complaint Rate**  
   * **<0.1%**: A complaint rate below 0.1% is excellent and shows that recipients are generally satisfied with your emails.  
   * **\>0.1%**: A higher complaint rate indicates that recipients are marking your emails as spam. Review your email content and ensure your recipients have opted in.
5. **RCPT Commands**  
   * This represents the total number of recipients who received your emails. A higher value indicates heavy email sending activity. Monitor this to ensure your email volume aligns with your expected campaign size.
6. **DATA Commands**  
   * This metric tracks the total number of data payloads processed. It reflects the email messages transmitted by your IP address. Ensure the volume is consistent with your planned email campaigns to avoid triggering spam filters.
7. **Trap Message Period**  
   * This shows the number of days your emails were detected by spam traps. Ideally, this value should be **0** days. Any non-zero value requires immediate investigation.
8. **Red Days (Filter Result Issues)**  
   * **0 Red Days**: Your email filtering metrics are in good standing, and emails are not being flagged as spam.  
   * **One or More Red Days**: Indicates that some days had higher spam rates or deliverability issues. Investigate the sending patterns for those periods and adjust accordingly.

### **How to Handle IP Blocking or High Spam Rates**

If your IP is blocked or has a high spam rate:

1. **Review Your Metrics**  
   * Analyze recent activities, especially around trap hits and complaints.
2. **Clean Your Mailing Lists**  
   * Remove invalid or inactive addresses and ensure all recipients have opted in.
3. **Request IP Delisting**  
   * If your IP is blocked, submit a delisting request using the [Microsoft Outlook Support page](https://olcsupport.office.com/).
