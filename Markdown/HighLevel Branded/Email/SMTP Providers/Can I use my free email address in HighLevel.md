## **Why You Need Your Own Domain To Send Email**

You might be thinking, "Why do I need my own domain to send email? Can't I just use my @gmail address?"

  
All marketing emails should be sent from a domain you own, not from a personal account at a provider domain, like @gmail, @hotmail, @yahoo, etc. or in an ISP email in some cases.

  
In almost all cases we've seen, those addresses can all issue a block whenever bulk email is sent from their domain. This is because the most important factor in email deliverability is domain reputation, and when you send mail from a Gmail account, you're actually using Gmail's reputation, not your own. 

  
**NOTE**: Even if your provider does not currently block email, it is very likely that all email providers will do so in the near future. The best way forward is to create an email address at a domain that you own, so you can start building up your own domain reputation!

  
Think of it this way

  
When you send something in the mail, a carrier (UPS, DHL, Post Office) transports it for you. But it's still coming from you, the carrier isn't just going to pick it up off the street (hopefully), and the recipient is more likely to accept a letter coming from someone they know. 

  
Email is much the same. HighLevel is the carrier, but it also depends on your sending reputation, and the domain email is how you build that trust.

  
## **How to get started:**

  
## Three ways to add email to your domain and start sending emails with that address.

  
## **1\. Where you bought your domain**

  
Almost all domain providers will be able to provide you with an option to add email to your purchase. Then you'll have the name@domain.com address you need, and even if you don't set up the Inbox entirely you can still set up forwarding to your normal Gmail or Yahoo address. Examples are sites like Google Domains, Namecheap, and Hover.

  
## **2\. Where you host your website**

  
Many people buy their domain the same place they host their website. BlueHost, HostGator, and GoDaddy all offer both domains and hosting so they are popular all-in-one options. Squarespace and Wix make it easy to add email to your account with options in your dashboard.

  
**NOTE**: For either option, the best way to find out how to do this is simply Google "website host and email account", with your host/provider in the search bar.

  
## **3\. Google Suite**

  
Did you know you can still use Gmail with your domain email? It's true! You can use G Suite to manage your domain email address, plus Google Docs, Sheets, and more! [Click here to sign up and get started](https://gsuite.google.com/), plans begin at $6/month.
