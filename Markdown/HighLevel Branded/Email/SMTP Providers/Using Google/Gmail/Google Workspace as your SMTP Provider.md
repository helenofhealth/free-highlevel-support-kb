## **FAQs**

### **Q: What is the benefit of using an app-specific password for Gmail SMTP integration?**

A: An app-specific password provides an additional layer of security and allows the app to access your Gmail account without you needing to input your password each time.

  
### **Q: What is the significance of 2-step verification in the context of Gmail SMTP integration?**

A: 2-step verification provides extra security to your account. When you set up an app-specific password, Google requires that you have 2-step verification enabled to ensure your account is protected.

  
### **Q: Why is it recommended to use a VPN while connecting to Gmail SMTP users in the Philippines?**

A: A VPN can help bypass regional restrictions and add an extra layer of security when connecting to Gmail SMTP. It might be particularly beneficial for users in certain regions like the Philippines.

  
### **Q: Can I use the same app-specific password for multiple applications?**

A: No, Google recommends creating a unique app-specific password for each application to enhance your account's security.

  
### **Q: What should I do if the 2-step verification option is not showing up on my Google account?**

A: If the 2-step verification option is not appearing, it could mean the feature is turned off in your Google Admin settings. You would need to contact your Google Workspace admin to enable the option.

  
### **Q: I have enabled 2-step verification and created an app-specific password, but my integration still isn't working. What can I do?**
