Setting up Mailgun for Locations:

  
* You can configure each location with your client's own Mailgun or your mailgun
* We can use the same Mailgun API and the same domain/subdomain for multiple locations
* We can use the same Mailgun API and different domains/subdomains for multiple locations
* We can use the different Mailgun API and domain/subdomain for multiple locations

Setting up LC email for Locations:

* If you add the custom domain at the agency level, it will be used for all sub-accounts until you set up a custom domain at the subaccount level. In that case, it will use the subaccount one as the priority.
