## By Default

  
If I mask the sender email like testing@gmail.com, the reply-to address will show as testing@**[replies.subdomain.com](https://replies.subdomain.com/)** and there's no way to change this, replies.subdomain.com is the Mailgun subdomain you set up for the sub-account in agency Settings-> Email Services. **Only when** the contact replies to the email sent from Highlevel, the replies will show up in the Conversation tab. If the contact initiates an email to testing@**[replies.subdomain.com](https://replies.subdomain.com/), replies won't show up in the Conversation if the domain is set up for more than one sub-account.** 
  
  
## Cold Email Inbound Setup

  
## **1\. Set up Mailgun** 

**[](https://gohighlevelassist.freshdesk.com/support/solutions/folders/48000665892)**[](https://gohighlevelassist.freshdesk.com/support/solutions/folders/48000665892)[Check out how to set up Mailgun](https://gohighlevelassist.freshdesk.com/support/solutions/folders/48000665892)[](https://gohighlevelassist.freshdesk.com/support/solutions/folders/48000665892)**[](https://gohighlevelassist.freshdesk.com/support/solutions/folders/48000665892)**

  
We will set up agency.com / mg.agency.com with Mailgun

  
\- You can use the same Mailgun account for all sub-accounts

E.g. If you have a domain like [agency.com](//agency.com), you can set up a unique subdomain for each sub-account like [subaccountname.agency.com](//locationname.agency.com) so each Sub-Account will have its own Mailgun subdomain set up to capture all email replies.

  
If your clients have their own domain, you can also set up a unique domain/subdomain for them. But if their main domain is already used for another email service, we will need to use a subdomain in this case.

  
That way we will know which accounts to route the email to.
  
  
## **2\. Make sure the Mailgun domain is configured for ONE sub-account only**

As long as there is **only ONE sub-account** mapped to that mailgun domain you just set up, it will route all inbound emails to that sub-account.

  
Check Agency View > **Settings** \> **Email Services** \> **Location Settings**

If you are using the same subdomain/domain for multiple Highlevel sub-accounts, we will not know which sub-account to route the email replies to when the lead is emailing the reply-to email address **directly** instead of replying to the email sent from Highlevel.

If you only configure the domain/subdomain for one sub-account but it's still not working, check if the same domain is configured in the **Domain Services** tab as well

Please reach out to support if you recall that there might be a deleted sub-account with the same Mailgun domain selected.
  
  
## 3\. Test

  
If you set up [domain.com](//domain.com), We can then use testing@domain.com to capture incoming emails. So if the contact initiates the Conversation by sending an email to anything@domain.com, it will show up in the Conversation tab. 

  
If you set up a subdomain like mg.domain.com, We can then use anything@mg.domain.com to capture incoming emails.
