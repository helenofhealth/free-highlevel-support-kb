# **FAQ**

### **How does email verification work?**

Email verification checks emails against Mailgun's records when entering the system for the first time (form, survey, calendars, chat widget) or when sending a new email **after** enabling email verification**.** And every 90 days if enabled.

  
Head into the contact record >scroll down the right side > click the envelope icon.

* Green = Valid
* Red = Invalid, too old, previously bounced, unsubscribed, etc. The error would specify why the Email is invalid.
