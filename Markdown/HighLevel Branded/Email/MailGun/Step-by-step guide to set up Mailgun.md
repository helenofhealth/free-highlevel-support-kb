**4\. If your domain is companyname.com, you can either set up the main domain or subdomain with Mailgun.** 

  
* Main domain:  
   * If you are adding the main domain, it should not be used with Gsuite, or any other email provider
* Subdomain:  
   * To set up the subdomain with Mailgun, you can type **ANYTHING\_HERE**.companyname.com  
         * Examples:  
                  * mg.companyname.com  
                  * replies.companyname.com  
                  * support.companyname.com
* Please set up the domain or subdomain under US, **not EU**.
* Click **Add domain**

**5\. Now log in to your DNS records based on where you get the domain and add the 5 DNS records.** 

  
* If you are not sure where you should add the DNS records
* Step 1: lookup domain that we are trying to set up in [mxtoolbox](https://mxtoolbox.com/SuperTool.aspx)
* Only put the domain here, **do not add http:// in front**

Once you look up the domain, it should show what your DNS hosting provider is.

* Step 2: check the bottom note it will say reported by e.g. [wordpress.com](//wordpress.com)
* Now we could add the DNS records to the domain provider. We can google **wordpress DNS records** if you are not sure where to locate the DNS records area.
  
  
Based on what your domain provider is, now we could add the DNS records according to the domain provider:
