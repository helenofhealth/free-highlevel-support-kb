## **Error list:**

  
### **The domain is not allowed to send:** 

The domain is unverified and requires DNS configuration. Log in to your control panel to view the required DNS records.

  
Log in to Mailgun - [](https://login.mailgun.com/login/)<https://login.mailgun.com/login/>

  
1\. Expand **Sending** tab

  
2\. Click the last menu item, **Domain Settings**

  
3\. Make sure you select the correct domain/subdomain for the location on top

  
4\. Click **DNS records** on the top middle

  
5\. Click **Verify DNS settings** and see if all 5 DNS records have a green checkmark?

  
Sometimes it might show if they have all green checkmarks but it might not be the case, you will need to click the Verify DNS Settings button again to refresh the record:

## **The domain is not allowed to send: Account Terminated.**

  
The agency must contact Mailgun support to see why it got terminated.

## **Too old**

  
It is one of Mailgun's internal errors that you can clear in the HighLevel agency settings. But to find out why you are getting that error, you will need to contact Mailgun support to check further.

### **Mailgun Send verification error.**

  
If the sender's address is missing or illegible, it may never reach its destination, and even if it does, the recipient won't be able to respond. Similarly, a sender address verification error can occur in email communication if the recipient server fails to locate the sending domain's necessary MX records (Mail Exchanger records).

Here's how the problem usually manifests itself:

1. 550 Verification failed for <bounce+c72392.3559d@yoursendingdomain.com>\\nUnrouteable address\\nSender verify failed
2. The domain of the sender address bounce+c72392.3559d@yoursendingdomain.com does not exist
3. Sender address rejected: User unknown in virtual mailbox table
4. Could not resolve sender domain
5. Your domain has no DNS/MX entries
6. Requested action not taken: mailbox unavailable invalid DNS MX or A/AAAA resource record.

Here are some steps you can take to fix this issue based on your current Mailgun sending domain:

####   
**If you're using a subdomain:**

Although not required, we highly recommend pointing your MX records for the domain to Mailgun. This helps prevent Sender Verification Errors.

Set the MX records for the subdomain to Mailgun values to fix the error. These are:

* Value: mxa.mailgun.org, Priority: 10
* Value: mxb.mailgun.org, Priority: 10

Wait 24-48 hours for the records to propagate fully, and the error should disappear.

If you still see the error, try adjusting the domain in the From field of the message to match the sending domain.

####   
**If you're using a root domain:**

If your root domain already has your Email Service Provider's (ESP's) MX records in place, the best solution is to add a subdomain for your Mailgun sending. The error should be resolved once you've added the subdomain and configured Mailgun's MX records.

  
**Please Note:**

If your root domain doesn't have or needs MX records pointing to a hosted mailbox provider, you can add the root domain to your Mailgun account, verify the required TXT AND MX records, and send through the root domain.

  
Remember: Only point your MX records for a domain to one source to avoid email misdirection or loss.

3\. Alternate Approaches:

If the error persists after trying the above steps, consider these alternatives:

* Turn off sender address verification (on the server side with your email provider).
* Create a "catch-all" within the configuration of your email provider. This ensures that Sender Address Verification will pass when the recipient server checks the sender information for incoming emails.

Understanding and troubleshooting these kinds of issues can be technical, but following these steps should help you resolve sender verification errors.

### **Too many requests**

The error means that too many email requests were sent simultaneously. Please get in touch with Mailgun support to check for an email limit with the Mailgun account.

  
You can clear the error in the agency settings -> Email services tab.
