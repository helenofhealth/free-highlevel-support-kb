## **Why You'd Want or Need to Delete Your Domain**

There are a few reasons why you may want or need to delete your LC Email dedicated sending domain:

  
1. ### **You Added the Wrong Domain**  
Sometimes we add the wrong domain, which will affect your ability to connect the DNS services in order to get email up and running. In this case you would need to delete the domain and add the correct domain.
2. ### **You Changed Domains for your Business**  
If you change the domain of your business, you would most likely want to change your main sending domain in order to match your business. This can also be very important when it comes to your email reputation score since email service providers like Google are looking to see if your sending domain matches your business' identity in an attempt to validate who you are and protect their users.
3. ### **Your Domain was Marked as Spam and Deliverability is Low**  
If you send a lot of marketing emails, there is a chance you have been marked as spam too many times and your email reputation score has suffered because of this. When this happens, your email deliverability will suffer, and you will most likely need to change sending domains in order to increase your success rates. This may require you to delete your sending domain entirely in order to add a new one. Usually this is not the case, but if you have decided that you will no longer send from the spam domain, there is no reason to have it connected to your sub-account any longer.

  
**Please Note:** There may be more reasons to delete your sending domain depending on your specific use case and niche.

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

  
### **Q:** **What happens after my email domain is deleted from my sub-account?**

Once you delete your sending domain from your sub-account, the DNS records are removed from that domain. This will allow you to connect that domain to another email service if needed.
  
  
### **Q: Can I reconnect my sending domain to the same sub-account at a later date if I deleted it?**

Yes! If you delete/remove your sending domain from your sub-account, you can always reconnect it at a later date. Just remember that there may be some time in between reconnecting it and when the DNS records propagate. This will depend on your domain hosting service.
  
  
### **Q: Will deleting my sending domain negatively affect my email deliverability rate?**

This depends and will vary from case to case. If you have a high deliverability rate on the domain that you're deleting, then most likely yes, because the new domain you would be adding would need time to build up a positive reputation score.

  
If the sending domain you're deleting already has a poor deliverability rate, then adding a new one may actually help you increase the amount of emails that get delivered on a daily, weekly, and monthly basis!
