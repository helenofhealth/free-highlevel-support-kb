A “default header” provides a fallback From Name and From Email for outbound messages sent via a dedicated sending domain when DMARC alignment fails. This ensures deliverability and brand consistency, even if a campaign’s custom header does not match the authenticated domain.

## **When to Use Default Headers**

* **Fallback for DMARC Failures**: If a campaign’s “From” address does not align with your dedicated sending domain’s DKIM/SPF records, HighLevel will automatically switch to the configured default header so that the message is still authenticated.
* **Maintain Consistent Branding**: Even if a typo or misconfiguration causes a non-aligned “From,” recipients will see your brand’s domain in the From field rather than a rejected address.
* **Regulatory/Compliance Requirements**: Industries requiring strict email authentication (finance, healthcare, etc.) should configure default headers to avoid DMARC rejections or quarantines.

## **Prerequisites**

  
Before you can configure default headers, ensure that:

  
1. **You’re in a Sub-Account**  
   * Only sub-accounts can add and manage dedicated sending domains and set default headers. Agency-level domains do not support per-sub-account default headers.
2. **Dedicated Sending Domain Is Added and Validated**  
   * You have completed DNS setup (CNAME, DKIM, and SPF) for your custom sending domain (e.g., `email.yourbrand.com`).  
   * HighLevel displays a green checkmark indicating your domain is validated under **Settings → Email Service → SMTP Service → Dedicated Domain and IP**

## **Setting Default Headers (From Name & From Email)**

  
You can set up default "From address and Email" for dedicated domains under your account only for the Sub-account created domains.

  
Navigate to **Sub-account Settings - Email Service -> SMTP Service -> Dedicated Domain and IP -> Set headers under dedicated domain.**

The designated header will be applied to emails sent through the dedicated domain when DMARC alignment fails.

  
## **How Default Headers Work in Practice**

1. **Campaign Configuration**  
   * When creating a broadcast or workflow email, you can set a campaign-level “From Name” and “From Email.”  
   * If you intentionally use a different “From Email” (e.g., `sales@differentdomain.com`) that does not align with your dedicated domain (`email.yourbrand.com`), DMARC will fail.
2. **DMARC Check & Fallback**  
   * At send time, HighLevel checks DMARC alignment between the campaign’s “From” address and the sending domain’s DKIM/SPF records.  
   * **If alignment passes**: The email goes out with the campaign’s chosen “From.”  
   * **If alignment fails**: HighLevel overrides the campaign’s “From” with the default header you configured under that dedicated domain.
3. **Recipient Experience**  
   * Recipients see a valid “From Name” and “From Email” that matches your authenticated sending domain.  
   * The email remains DMARC-compliant and is less likely to be rejected or flagged as spam.

## **Best Practices & Considerations**

  
1. **Configure Default Headers Before Sending:** Always set up your fallback header prior to launching major campaigns. If DNS or DMARC misconfiguration occurs, your default header will kick in automatically.
2. **Monitor Replies:** The default “From Email” can be any address at your sending domain, but ensure mailboxes or aliases are monitored (e.g., `support@yourbrand.com` forwarding to the correct team).
3. **Test Before Scaling:** Send a small internal test using a non-aligned “From” address to confirm HighLevel defaults properly. Check both inbox placement and DMARC status.
4. **Understand Propagation Delays:** Changing DNS (especially DKIM/SPF/TXT records) can take up to 48 hours to fully propagate. Without default headers, messages sent during propagation may be rejected.
5. **Segregate by Sub-Account:** If you manage multiple brands or departments, create separate sub-accounts—each with its own dedicated domain and default headers—for isolated control.

## **Common Troubleshooting Scenarios**

  
| Issue                                                    | Possible Cause                                                                     | Resolution                                                                                                                               |
| -------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **“Set headers” option is not visible**                  | You’re in an agency-level view or the domain is not validated under a sub-account. | Switch to the correct sub-account. Add/validate a dedicated domain in Settings → Email Service → SMTP Service → Dedicated Domain and IP. |
| **Emails still failing to send after fallback**          | DNS records (DKIM/SPF) are incomplete or incorrectly formatted.                    | Double-check DNS entries for your sending domain. Use online DKIM/SPF validators. Wait for propagation.                                  |
| **Fallback header not applied when expected**            | Campaign “From” address aligns with the sending domain (even if unintended).       | Verify the campaign’s “From Email” is genuinely non-aligned (e.g., domain mismatch). Check DMARC reports to confirm failures.            |
| **Recipients see the wrong “From Name” or “From Email”** | The campaign or workflow may hard-code a display name that overrides expectations. | Edit the campaign/workflow “From Name” and “From Email.” Ensure fallback is correctly spelled and free of stray spaces.                  |
| **SSL certificate not issued for the sending domain**    | Missing or incorrect CNAME/DNS records for domain validation.                      | In Settings → Dedicated Domain, click “Edit DNS Info” and follow the instructions exactly. Wait for propagation before retrying.         |
