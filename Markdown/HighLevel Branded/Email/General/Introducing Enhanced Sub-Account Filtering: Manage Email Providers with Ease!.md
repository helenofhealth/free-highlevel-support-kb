We're excited to announce an enhanced feature that enables agency users to filter sub-accounts based on their email provider.

  
Currently supported providers include LeadConnector, Mailgun, and others (excluding LC and Mailgun, such as Gmail and SMTP).

  
**Filtering Sub-Accounts:**

  
Now, users have the ability to filter sub-accounts based on three key criteria:

* **Provider**: Easily filter sub-accounts by specifying the provider they belong to.
* **Domain**: Filter sub-accounts by their associated domain name.
* **Email Verification**: Filter sub-accounts based on their email verification status, whether it’s enabled or not.

**Different Providers:**

  
We’ve organized the filtering process for two main providers, LC and Mailgun, and Others.

**LC**:

* Filter sub-accounts specifically under LC.
* Change the domain for selected sub-accounts.
* Enable or disable email verification as needed.

**Mailgun**:

* Filter sub-accounts under Mailgun.
* Switch the provider to LC for selected sub-accounts.
* Modify the Mailgun domain for the chosen sub-accounts.

**Others**:

* For sub-accounts not falling under LC or Mailgun, filter them by selecting “Others.”
* Change the provider to LC for these sub-accounts.

This feature provides more flexibility and customization options for managing sub-accounts email services efficiently.
