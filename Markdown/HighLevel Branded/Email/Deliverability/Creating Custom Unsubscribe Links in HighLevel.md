# **What Are Custom Unsubscribe Links?**

  
Custom unsubscribe links are personalized opt-out links embedded in marketing emails, allowing recipients to unsubscribe from future communications in a way that aligns with your brand. Unlike default unsubscribe links, which often redirect users to a generic confirmation page, **custom unsubscribe links give you full control** over the user experience.

---

## **Key Benefits of Custom Unsubscribe Links**

  
* **Enhance User Experience:** Direct users to a branded landing page that confirms their opt-out decision.
* **Provide Subscription Preferences:** Allow users the option to opt out of specific types of emails instead of all communications.
* **Maintain Compliance:** Ensure compliance with email marketing regulations like the CAN-SPAM Act and GDPR.
* **Improve Deliverability:** Reduce spam complaints by offering a clear and easy way for recipients to unsubscribe.

  
**Note:** Custom unsubscribe links in HighLevel use **trigger links** and **workflows** to automatically mark contacts as **"Do Not Disturb" (DND)**, preventing them from receiving further emails.

## **Creating Custom Unsubscribe Links**

  
Follow these steps to set up a custom unsubscribe link in HighLevel:

  
### **Step 1:** Create an Unsubscribe Landing Page

  
Design a landing page that confirms the unsubscribe action. This page should inform users that they have successfully unsubscribed and if desired, offer options to manage their subscription preferences.  
  
1. Navigate to **Sites** and then **Funnels** from your HighLevel sub.
2. Click on **\+ New Funnel** and name it **Email Unsubscribe**.
3. Within this funnel, add a new step named "**Email Unsubscribe Page**" with a path like **/unsubscribe**.

Design the page content to **reflect the unsubscribe confirmation message.** We have added a demo page below for your reference. Check out our [Funnel Styling guide](https://help.gohighlevel.com/en/support/solutions/articles/48000980309) (*needs to be updated) for more information.

### **Step 2:** Set Up a Trigger Link  

  
A trigger link in HighLevel allows you to perform specific actions when a contact clicks on a particular link. In this case, clicking the unsubscribe link will update their preferences.

  
1. Go to **Marketing** then **Trigger** **Links** from your HighLevel sub-account.
2. Select **Links** from the dropdown and click on the **Add Link** button.
3. Add the **name** of the link.
4. Paste the **URL of the unsubscribe landing page** you created earlier into the **Link URL field**.
5. Click on **Save**.

### **Step 3:** Create a Workflow to Manage Unsubscribes

  
Set up a workflow that automatically updates the contact's status when they click the unsubscribe link.

#### 

1. Navigate to **Automation** from your HighLevel sub-account and select **Workflows**.
2. Click on **\+ Create Workflow** and select **\+ Start from Scratch**.
3. **Name** the workflow.

#### **Set Up the Trigger**

  
1. Click on **Add New Trigger** and select **Trigger Link Clicked** from events.  
    
   1. Add the **Workflow Trigger Name**.  
   2. Click on **Add Filter** and select **Trigger Link** from the drop-down.  
   3. Select your **previously saved Email Unsubscribe Trigger link** from the drop-down.

#### **Add the DND Action**  
  
1. Click on the **+** button to add an Action.
2. Select **Enable/Disable DND** action.

### **Step 4:** Insert the Unsubscribe Link into Your Emails  

  
1. In your **email template editor**, add text like **Unsubscribe** or **Unsubscribe from this list**.
2. **Highlight** this text and click the **link** icon.
3. Click on **Trigger Links** from the Link URL dropdown and select the saved **Unsubscribe Link**.
4. **Save** the template.
  
  
**Note:** 

Emails sent via workflows do not automatically include unsubscribe links. To stay compliant, you must manually add the unsubscribe trigger link to each email template used in a workflow. 

To do this, highlight text such as **“Unsubscribe”** or **“Click here to unsubscribe”** in your email template, click the link icon, and select your custom unsubscribe trigger link from the dropdown. This ensures recipients can opt out no matter where the email originates.
