# **What is the Product Tour Guide in LaunchPad?**

  
The Product Tour Guide is an interactive, step-by-step helper embedded within each LaunchPad action. It replaces static video tutorials and guides users directly through completing tasks in the platform. This tour ensures each action is completed correctly by walking you through it in real time, reducing the need for guesswork or toggling between videos and the app.

  
## **Key Benefits of the Product Tour Guide**

  
Interactive guides give users a more seamless and confident onboarding experience. By showing exactly what to do and where, the product tour guide reduces user confusion and increases task completion rates.

* Step-by-step walkthroughs ensure actions are completed correctly.
* No need to toggle between help videos and your workspace.
* Completes the actual task in the platform as you follow along.
* Reduces learning time and support requests.
* Optimized for onboarding success and Time to Productivity (TTP).
* Seamlessly embedded in LaunchPad for easy access.

  
## **How To Use the Product Tour Guide in LaunchPad**

  
The new tour guide experience activates automatically when you click on an eligible LaunchPad action, replacing the traditional tutorial video with an interactive walkthrough.

  
**Steps to Use the Product Tour Guide:**

1. Go to your **Dashboard** and open **LaunchPad**.
2. Click any action listed in the LaunchPad (e.g., “Connect Facebook,” “Add a Pipeline”).
3. Instead of a tutorial video, a product tour guide will launch in-app.
4. Follow the highlighted steps that appear on-screen to complete the action.
5. Once completed, the LaunchPad action will automatically be marked as complete.

  
## **A/B Testing of the New Experience**

  
To evaluate the impact of the new product tour guide on user success, we’re conducting an A/B test among our customers.

* **50% of users** will experience the new product tour guide.
* **50% of users** will continue to see the existing tutorial videos.
* This test helps us measure how the guided experience affects onboarding metrics, especially **Time to Productivity (TTP).**

  
## **Availability & Access**

  
The Product Tour Guide is currently limited to a specific customer group as part of a phased rollout.

* **Who gets it?** New customers on the **$97/month** plan.
* **Who doesn’t?** Existing customers and customers on other pricing tiers still see the traditional tutorial videos.
* **Where is it active?** Only in the **new LaunchPad** interface.

  
If you’re not seeing the tour guide, you are likely in the control group of the A/B test or using an older version of the LaunchPad.

##   

## **What’s Coming Next**

  
We’re building a self-service platform that enables internal teams to create, manage, and deploy their own product tour guides. This future expansion will:

* Empower more teams to educate users through interactive guidance.
* Allow faster onboarding across all features.
* Provide a standardized and scalable experience for new and existing customers alike.

  
_Stay tuned—this capability will significantly boost our ability to deliver consistent in-app help as we grow._
