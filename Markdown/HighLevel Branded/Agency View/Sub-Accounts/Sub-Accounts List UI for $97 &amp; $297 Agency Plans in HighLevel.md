## **Advanced Filtering in the Sub-Accounts List**

  
The **new Sub-Accounts List UI** in HighLevel now includes an **Advanced Filter** option, available to agency users on the **$97 and $297 plans**. These filters help you quickly find sub-accounts based on specific platform features, configurations, or status.

  
### **Step 1:** Add a Basic Filter

  
1. Click on the **Filter(Funnel)** button at the top of the Sub-Accounts List.
2. The **Advanced Filters panel** will slide open, displaying four filter categories:  
    
   * **General** (e.g., Date Added, Snapshots)  
   * **Reselling** (e.g., Listings, WhatsApp, Email, AI tools)  
   * **Rebilling** (e.g., Email/Phone Verification, LC Premium)  
   * **LeadConnector** (e.g., LC Email, LC Phone)
3. Click on any **Search** **Filed** of your choice under any of the above four categories.
4. Select the **Conditions** you want to filter by for the particular search filed.
5. Add an **OR Logic filter** by clicking the **\+ Add Filter** button.

  
**OR Logic:** At least one condition must be true for a result to be shown. Filters are applied so that data matching any one of the conditions is included.  
  
**Example:** If you filter by (LC Email is Enabled or LC Phone is Enabled), this will return sub-accounts that have either LC Email or LC Phone enabled (or both).

### **Step 2:** Add Nested Filters (Optional)

  
1. Click on the **\+ Add Nested Filter** button.
2. This filter works on the **AND Logic.**

  
**And Logic:** All conditions must be true for a result to be shown. Filters are combined so that the data must match every specified condition.  
  
**Example:** If you filter by (Date Added after Jan 1 and LC Email is Enabled), this will only show sub-accounts that were added after Jan 1 and also have LC Email enabled.

### **Step 3:** Apply and Review Filter Results

  
1. Click **Apply** to run the filters.
2. The system will return matching sub-accounts. If no results match, a message will appear:  
“No more locations found.”
