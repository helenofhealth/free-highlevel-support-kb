We’re excited to introduce a powerful new feature in the Prospecting Tool: **Prospect Categories**. This update is designed to help users better organize and manage their growing list of prospects by allowing them to create custom categories, assign them to individual prospects, and easily filter based on those categories. Whether you’re looking to group similar prospects, tag high-priority leads, or streamline bulk updates, this new categorization system makes prospect management more efficient and scalable—especially for agencies handling large volumes of leads.
