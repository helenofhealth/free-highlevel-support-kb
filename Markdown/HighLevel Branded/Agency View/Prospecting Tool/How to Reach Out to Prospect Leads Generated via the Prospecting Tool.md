## Where Can You Use Prospecting?

Prospecting is available in **two areas**:

* **Agency View** – for lead discovery and basic prospecting
* **Sub-Account View** – for **advanced engagement and automation**

> **Only Sub-Accounts** can send emails, SMS, and run workflows. That’s why prospecting efforts are most powerful when done (or migrated) inside a sub-account.
