# **What is Prospect Migration?**

  
Prospect Migration enables agencies to transfer selected prospects from the agency-level Prospecting Dashboard to a specific sub-account. This provides a more personalized and efficient way to manage leads, allowing the sub-account to engage with them using its own workflows and tools.

  
By migrating prospects to sub-accounts, agencies can delegate follow-up tasks to individual teams or clients while retaining visibility and ownership at the agency level. This leads to more focused marketing efforts and better lead conversion.

## **Prerequisites**

  
1. The destination **sub-account must have Premium Prospecting activated**.
2. You must have **existing prospects available at the agency level**.
