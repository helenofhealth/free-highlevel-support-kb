**Prospecting at sub account level enables you to do more advanced prospecting from finding new leads, nurturing and outreach them seamlessly at one place. Therefore now Prospecting is available in** two areas:

1. **In Agency**  – for lead discovery and basic prospecting
2. **In Sub-Account**  – for advanced engagement and automation
