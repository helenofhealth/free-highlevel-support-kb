Key Benefits:

 Gain visibility into whether a prospect is actively running Google Ads, offering a clearer picture of their advertising investments.
* New Sales Opportunities:  
 Detecting Google Ads usage opens up new avenues to approach prospects with targeted advertising solutions, boosting potential conversion rates and increasing your agency’s value proposition.
