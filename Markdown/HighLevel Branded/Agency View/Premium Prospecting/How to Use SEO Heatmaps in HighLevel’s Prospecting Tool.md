# **What is an SEO Heatmap?**

  
The SEO Heatmap is a tool that plots search rankings across nine key points on a map, giving a geographic view of how well a website ranks in different locations. Each point on the heatmap corresponds to a specific location around the prospect's business, helping to identify areas where the business has strong visibility versus areas that need improvement.

## **Key Benefits of the SEO Heatmap Tool**

  
* **Geographic Insights:** It helps you visualize your ranking performance across different areas, providing a clear picture of where SEO efforts are succeeding or need improvement.
* **Targeted Optimizations:** Use the heatmap to identify specific geographic areas where visibility is lacking and optimize your SEO strategy to boost rankings in those locations.
* **Improved Local Search Strategy:** For businesses relying on local search, this heatmap can reveal how well they are performing in nearby areas, helping them adjust their local SEO strategies accordingly.

## **How does the SEO Heatmap Tool Work?**

  
The SEO Heatmap evaluates search visibility based on rankings across multiple points:  
  
1. **Central Point (20% Weight):** The central location of the business. This point receives the highest weight in the overall score and reflects the visibility of the business in its immediate area.
2. **Outer Points (10% Weight Each):** Eight surrounding points that represent nearby areas. These points help provide insight into how well the business ranks in neighboring locations.

  
Each point is assigned a rank based on the business’s position in search results for the selected keyword or keyword set. The higher the rank of a point, the better the visibility in that location, and the stronger the overall SEO performance.
