## **Trigger Description**

The "Prospect Generated" trigger activates automated workflows when a new prospect is created in the Prospecting Tool. This can happen in three ways:

1. **In-App:** When a prospect is manually generated within the tool.
2. **Widget:** When a prospect is generated through an embedded widget on your website.
3. **Prospect AI** **:** When a prospect is generated automatically via Prospect AI

This trigger allows you to filter and organise prospects based on:

* **Source:** Identify whether the prospect originated in-app or via a widget or via the AI
* **Conversion Rate:** Segment prospects by their likelihood to convert, enabling targeted engagement.

  
You can also use merge fields to include custom values in your email

This customisation makes it easier to prioritise high-potential leads and streamline your sales process.
