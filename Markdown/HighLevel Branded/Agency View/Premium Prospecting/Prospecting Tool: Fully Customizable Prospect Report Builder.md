# **What is Fully Customizable Prospect Report Builder?**

  
This premium feature is designed to give users full control over the appearance and content of their prospect reports. It enables agencies and locations to customize their report’s brand theme, header, introduction message, and footer sections, ensuring that every report reflects a distinct, professional identity. With an easy-to-use interface and live preview capabilities, you can build and refine reports that not only look great but also drive engagement.

  
**UI Enhancements:**

  
* **Streamlined Header**  
   1. The previous sticky header that took up too much space is now fixed.  
   2. The header no longer obstructs content while scrolling.
* **Optimized Layout**  
   1. We’ve removed empty white margins from both sides.  
   2. The report is now **cleaner, more compact**, and easier to navigate — with better content visibility and focus.
