   * Uncheck any sections you do **not** want to include in your reports.
4. **Reorder Sections**  
   * Use drag-and-drop to change the order of the sections.  
   * This helps you define the narrative flow that makes the most sense for your agency and clients.

# **Customizing Layout for a Specific Report Only**

If you want to tailor a single report—for a specific prospect or use case—you can do that without affecting your global settings.

### Steps:

1. **Open any Report:** Navigate to the Prospect Report you’d like to customize.
2. **Access Section Controls**  
In the top-right corner of the report, click on the **"Sections"** button.
3. **Customize as Needed**  
   * Drag and drop sections to reorder them.  
   * Check or uncheck sections to include or exclude them from this particular report.
4. **Save Changes**  
These layout changes will apply **only to this report** (and this prospect).  
Your global layout settings will remain unaffected.
