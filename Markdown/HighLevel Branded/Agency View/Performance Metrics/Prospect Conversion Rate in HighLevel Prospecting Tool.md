## **How is the Conversion Rate Calculated?**

The Conversion Rate is calculated on the basis of several key factors:  
  
**1\. Google Business Profile Claim Status:** If the GBP is already claimed by the prospect, their chance for becoming a client is considerably lower and had an impact on our conversion Rate.  
**2\. Online Reviews:** Prospects who have a considerably lesser reviews left by customers along with their recent reviews having negative reviews implies that they could really use help from Marketing Agencies to improve their reputation game. On the other hand,Prospects who have more reviews left by customer and if the recent reviews are all positive, it is highly unlikely for them to look for an Agency to manage their business/sales.  
**3.Business Website:** If the Prospect already has a website for their business, it implies that they already are aware of online strategies to win clients or increase sales and this could negatively impact the conversion Rate. Likewise, No business website, indicates that the prospect is yet to explore the digital realm.  
**4\. Chat Widget in Website:** Prospects who have a chat widget on their website are more likely to actively connect with their clients and resolve queries thereby increasing their sales/services. If the Prospect has no chatWidget, the agency can then offer their services to set up a website and/or other marketing initiatives to empower these prospects in the online space. Hence theseProspects will have a higher conversion rate
