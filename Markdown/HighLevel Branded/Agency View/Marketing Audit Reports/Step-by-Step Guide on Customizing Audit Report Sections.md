## Tips for Customising Reports:

* **Prioritise Important Information:** Always place the most relevant or impactful sections at the top to ensure they grab attention.
* **Use a Logical Flow:** Organise sections in a way that tells a cohesive story, from overview metrics to more detailed insights.
* **Keep Reports Concise:** Only include sections that add value to avoid overwhelming the reader with too much information.

By following these steps, you can easily tailor your reports to suit your specific needs, ensuring they are informative and well-structured.
