## **Frequently Asked Questions**

  
**Q: How long does it take for my edits to appear on Google Maps?**

Most updates (hours, phone, photos, etc.) sync within a few minutes, but Google can take up to 24 hours to review and publish certain changes, especially address edits.

  
**Q: What does a low profile score actually affect?**

A lower score means your listing is missing details that Google uses for ranking and trust signals (e.g., business hours, high-quality photos). Completing the flagged items generally improves local search visibility and click-through rates.

  
**Q: Can I manage multiple GBPs at once?**

Yes, if you have multiple GBPs connected, you can use the location switcher in the upper-right corner above the live preview panel to switch between different profiles.

  
**Q: How does the live preview feature work?**

The live preview component shows real-time changes to your listing, ensuring you see exactly how your updates will appear on Google Maps.

  
**Q: What does the profile score indicate?**

The profile score evaluates the completeness of your listing and highlights any missing or incomplete information with alert icons and tooltips.
