## **Re-billing the costs to your clients and making a profit:**

Once you have enabled Reviews AI in your agency account, it will automatically enable all your clients to use it. You can bill your clients at cost or add an additional markup of your choosing.

### **How to turn on re-billing for my clients?**

1. Ensure you have enabled **Reviews AI** for your Agency first.
2. If the sub-account isn't in SaaS Mode already, switch the sub-account into SaaS Mode by going into your **Agency account** \> **Accounts tab** \> **Scroll to the sub-account** \> Click the **three dots icon** and select "**Switch to SaaS.**" Please refer to this article to learn [How to convert a location to SaaS](https://help.gohighlevel.com/en/support/solutions/articles/48001184920).
3. In **Agency account** \> **Accounts tab** \> Scroll to the **Sub-Account** \> Click the **View Details** link > **Scroll to the Reviews AI Re-Sell Settings** section and toggle it on.
4. Use the slider to set the amount of markup you like to make and hit save.
5. Rinse and repeat for all your Sub-Accounts where you wish to re-bill for usage.

### **How does re-billing work?**

* Agencies pay HighLevel and get invoices with HighLevel branding
* Sub-accounts (your clients) pay you (the agency) and get invoices with your branding. The money is deposited in your Stripe account connected to your agency level. [How do I connect my agency's Stripe account to collect payments from my clients?](https://help.gohighlevel.com/en/support/solutions/articles/48001171910)

This is very similar to other products that use re-billing or reselling models in the platform. Just like LC Phone or LC Email re-billing, re-billing of the Content AI also utilizes "credits" from the agency wallet & the location wallet, respectively.
