## How To Use the Guided Review Setup Wizard

The wizard automatically appears on the Reputation Management Overview screen for newly created sub-accounts that have not yet configured reviews. It includes six guided steps that walk users through the full setup journey. Once all steps are complete, the wizard disappears and will not reappear.

## Step 1 – Connect GBP or Facebook Pages

Connecting your Google Business Profile or Facebook Page is the first step toward collecting reviews from these platforms. This connection enables review data to be pulled directly into the system.

* Click on "Connect Review Platforms" within the wizard
* You will be redirected to the Integrations page
* Select either Google or Facebook and follow the connection prompts

## Step 2 – Setup Review Link

A custom review link allows you to request feedback from customers directly. This step ensures that the link is active and ready for use in messages or widgets.

* The wizard redirects to Settings → Review Link
* Customize or confirm your default review link
* Copy this link for use in review request workflows

## Step 3 – Send First Review Request

This step encourages users to begin engaging with customers by sending an initial review request.

* The wizard navigates to the Review Requests page
* Choose a contact or enter recipient information manually
* Send the review request via SMS or email

  
## Step 4 – Configure Reviews AI

Enabling Reviews AI allows the system to generate and publish automated responses to customer reviews, improving responsiveness and consistency.

* The wizard guides you to Settings → Reviews AI
* Toggle the AI response feature to “On”
* Select the desired tone and response behavior

## Step 5 – Create Review Widget

Review widgets display your positive reviews on your website to build trust with potential customers.

* The wizard takes you to the Widgets tab
* Choose from available widget styles (carousel, grid, list)
* Copy and embed the widget code into your website's HTML

## Step 6 – Connect More Review Platforms

After setting up your initial source, the wizard encourages users to explore additional platforms to maximize review collection opportunities.

* You will be directed back to the Integrations page
* Connect other available platforms such as Yelp or TripAdvisor, if applicable
