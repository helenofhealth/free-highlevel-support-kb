# **What are AI-Powered Review Summaries?**

  
The AI-Powered Review Summary is a smart, auto‑generated insight card that appears automatically for every user who has at least one connected review location. It rolls up feedback from all pages into a single-to-understand summary including a concise paragraph that explains overall sentiment, the most common themes and highlight tags (e.g., “great staff,” “slow service”). These summaries help save time, reveal trends instantly and are especially useful for multi-location businesses that track a high volume of reviews.
