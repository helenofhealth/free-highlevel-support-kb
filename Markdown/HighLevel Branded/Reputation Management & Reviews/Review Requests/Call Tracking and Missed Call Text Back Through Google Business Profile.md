Google Business Profile (GBP) allows a business to register two phone numbers, which creates an excellent opportunity for Agencies to track calls generated from Google Business Profile listings while keeping with SEO best practices (i.e.moving the business' real phone number to the secondary slot has not been found to negatively affect rankings).

  
The HighLevel Google Business Profile integration enables you to automatically move your client's main business number to the secondary slot and add their LeadConnector number to the first slot.

When you toggle on GBP Call Tracking, the following happens: 

  
* If the phone number in GBP is already a LeadConnector number from the HighLevel sub-account, nothing will be changed as the business's calls are already being tracked in HighLevel.
* If the phone number in GBP is also the forwarding number for any of the LeadConnector numbers in the HighLevel sub-account, HighLevel will move the current number to the secondary slot and add the LeadConnector number in the primary slot.
* If the phone number in GBP is not the forwarding number for any of the Twilio numbers in the corresponding HighLevel sub-account, HighLevel will move the current number to the secondary slot, add the LeadConnector number in the primary slot, and set the current number as the forwarding number for the LeadConnector number in the HighLevel sub-account.
