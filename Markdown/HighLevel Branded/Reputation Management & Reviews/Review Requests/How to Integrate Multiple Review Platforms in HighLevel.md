## **How to Integrate Review Platforms**

  
### **Step 1:** Navigate to Integrations

* In the Settings menu, locate and click on the **Integrations** tab.

### **Step 2:** Configure Integrations

  
* On the Integrations page, you'll see an option to input your page URL for each platform. Enter the specific URL for the review platform you wish to integrate. Make sure this URL points to your business's review page (e.g., your Yelp page or your Google business profile).
* After entering the URL, click on the **Integrate** button. The platform will automatically pull in the latest reviews from that platform, displaying them in your dashboard.
* You can repeat the same steps to integrate other review platforms. Once done, all the reviews will be displayed in one place, making it easier to monitor, manage, and respond to reviews from a variety of sources.
