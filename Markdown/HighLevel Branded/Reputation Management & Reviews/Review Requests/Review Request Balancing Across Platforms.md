# **What is Review Request Balancing?**

  
Review Request Balancing allows you to distribute review requests between multiple review platforms, such as Google and Facebook. Users can configure the ratio for redirection, ensuring a more even split of reviews across platforms.

  
**For example:**

* When Review Balancing is enabled for the first time, the default ratio is **50% Google** and **50% Facebook** _(if both pages are integrated)_.
* You can adjust the redirection percentages to suit your business needs.

# **Frequently Asked Questions**

  
**Q: What happens if only one platform is integrated?**

  
If only one platform (e.g., Google) is integrated, all review requests will automatically redirect to that platform until another platform (e.g., Facebook) is integrated.
  
  
**Q: Can I disable Review Balancing once it’s enabled?**

  
Yes. To disable Review Balancing:  
  
1. Go to Reputation > Settings > Review Link.
2. Toggle off the **Enable Review Balancing** option.

  
Disabling the feature will redirect all review requests to the default platform (e.g., Google) if it’s the only integrated option.
  
  
**Q: Can I edit the redirection ratio after it’s been configured?**

  
Yes, you can adjust the ratio at any time by:  
  
1. Going to Reputation > Settings > Review Link.
2. Clicking on **Configure Balance** and modifying the ratio.
  
  
**Q: What if I don’t configure a balance after enabling the feature?**

  
If you don’t configure a balance, the system will default to a 50%-50% split between Google and Facebook (if both platforms are integrated).
  
  
**Q: How do I know the current distribution of reviews?**

  
The **Configure Balance** modal displays the current distribution percentages, allowing you to monitor and adjust as needed.
