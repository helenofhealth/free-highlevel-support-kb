When you flag a review as inappropriate, Google may take action against the reviewer, such as removing the review or banning the reviewer from leaving future reviews. This is usually only done if the review violates Google’s guidelines, such as posting spam or containing offensive language. If you believe a review is fake or biased, you can report it to Google for further investigation.

  
**Please Note:**

_“This feature seems to only work for Google My Business accounts that have a small number of listings in them. I tried it in an account with 33 listings, and it said, ‘Based on the number of Business Profiles you manage, this process is not available.’ Our agency account also had too many listings to qualify to use it.”_
