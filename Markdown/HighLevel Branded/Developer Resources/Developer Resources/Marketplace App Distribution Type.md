## App Distribution Model

  
To configure your desired app distribution model, you have three fields:

| Field                                       | Values                                        | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| ------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Who is the target user of the app?          | ‘Agency’ / ‘Sub-account’                      | Who is going to interact with the app? In other words, whose access token does the app ultimately need?For 95% of the apps, this would be **“Sub-account” (Recommended)**This field cannot be modified once set.                                                                                                                    |
| Who can install the app?                    | ‘Both Agency and Sub-account’ / ‘Agency Only’ | Which user(s) may see and install the app from the Marketplace UI?The **recommended option is “Both Agency & Sub-account”**, to ensure your app has the maximum reachUse "Agency Only" If you’re build an app exclusively as a fully white-labelled SaaS feature that only agencies can discover and install to their sub-accounts. |
| Can this app be bulk-installed by agencies? | ‘Yes’ / ‘No’                                  | This is **purely for backwards compatibility** of apps already in the Marketplace. All apps added to the Marketplace going forward will be set to "Yes" (mandatory).If ‘Yes’, an agency owner/admin can install your app to multiple subaccounts in one operation.Once set to 'Yes', this field cannot be reverted back to 'No'.    |

## Backward compatibility

  
For all existing apps, to ensure the existing installation flow and token exchange mechanism is maintained, we have configured the fields as follows for the existing/legacy distribution types:
  
  
| Legacy Distribution Type | Developer’s distribution config mapping to ensure backward compatibility | Recommendation on how you can maximise the reach for your app |     |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
