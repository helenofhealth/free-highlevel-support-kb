## **Understanding Roles and Permissions**

Our RBAC system categorises developer users into three roles: Owner, Admin, and User. Each role has a distinct set of permissions to ensure appropriate access levels within your developer account.

####   

### **Roles and Their Permissions:**

**Owner:**

* **The initial user who signs up is designated as the Owner.**
* **Only one Owner per account.**
* **Full access to all features and settings.**
* **Cannot transfer ownership.**

**Admin:**

* **Similar to the Owner but cannot modify the Owner's details.**
* **Can manage other Admins and Users.**

**User:**

* **Restricted access compared to Admins and Owners.**
* **Limited to certain actions as detailed below.**

### **Maximum allowed permissions for each role:**

| **Permission**             | **Owner** | **Admin** | **User** |
| -------------------------- | --------- | --------- | -------- |
| **View apps**              | **Yes**   | **Yes**   | **Yes**  |
| **Create and manage apps** | **Yes**   | **Yes**   | **Yes**  |
| **Delete apps**            | **Yes**   | **Yes**   | **No**   |
| **Submit for review**      | **Yes**   | **Yes**   | **Yes**  |
| **View app earnings**      | **Yes**   | **Yes**   | **No**   |
| **Create & manage users**  | **Yes**   | **Yes**   | **No**   |
