The OAuth API for the CRM Marketplace offers developers two types of access: Location Level Access (also known as Sub-Account) and Agency Level Access (also known as Company). These access levels provide comprehensive control over location data at either the individual location or agency-wide level. With Location Level Access, developers can perform operations specific to a sub-account, while Agency Level Access enables them to manage data across the entire agency. This distinction ensures efficient data handling and enhanced CRM Marketplace API v2.0 interoperability.

In the Developer's Marketplace, developers obtain an Access Token through the OAuth process, which allows their app to make authenticated API requests to GoHighLevel. The Access Token is usually included in the Authorization header of API requests. [Understanding Access Tokens](https://www.oauth.com/oauth2-servers/access-tokens/)
* **AppID** \- This is the unique identifier for your marketplace application. You can find it below the app name.![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155001343880/original/sruOBgrJNZSpZPOl6voCkffehXwOI3cbiw.png?1687202766)
* **Conversation Provider ID** \- This is the unique identifier for the type of provider a user installs. You can find it under the name of the conversation provider name if you have created conversation providers for your app.![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155001343982/original/0M9QmyhmbfmOKZ2lEeT0H_GqBZFjVm05VA.png?1687203031)
* **Refresh Token:** A Refresh Token is a credential that can be used to obtain a new Access Token without requiring the user to reauthorize the app. It provides a longer-lasting authorization mechanism and helps maintain continuous access to GoHighLevel resources. When an Access Token expires, the Refresh Token can be used to obtain a new one.
* **OAuth (Open Authorization):** OAuth is an industry-standard protocol that enables secure app authorization and authentication. It allows users to grant permission to apps to access their GoHighLevel data without sharing their login credentials. OAuth involves an authorization process where users are redirected to GoHighLevel to authenticate and grant access to the app. [OAuth 2.0 Introduction](https://oauth.net/2/)
* **Redirect URI**: A Redirect URI is the URL that GoHighLevel will send users after authorizing the app's access. During the OAuth process, users are redirected to the app with an authorization code or access token appended to the Redirect URI after granting permission. [OAuth 2.0 Redirect URI](https://oauth.net/core/1.0a/#anchor6)
* **Authorization Code:** In the OAuth process, an Authorization Code is a short-lived credential obtained after a user successfully authorizes an app. The app exchanges this code for an Access Token and Refresh Token. [OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code Grant](https://oauth.net/2/grant-types/authorization-code/)
* **Scopes:** Scopes define the specific permissions and access rights an app requires to interact with GoHighLevel. When creating an app, developers specify the necessary scopes that align with their app's functionalities. Scopes can include reading, writing, or managing permissions for different resources within GoHighLevel. [OAuth 2.0 Scopes](https://oauth.net/2/scope/) and this resource is for [**Gohighlevel's OAuth Scopes.**](https://highlevel.stoplight.io/docs/integrations/vcctp9t1w8hja-scopes)
* **Endpoint:** An endpoint is a specific URL or URI representing an API resource or functionality. GoHighLevel's API exposes various endpoints that developers can access to perform specific actions or retrieve specific data.
* **Request:** A request is a communication made by an app to the GoHighLevel API. It includes the HTTP method (e.g., GET, POST), the URL or endpoint, headers, and required parameters or data.
* **Response:** A response is the server's reply to a request made by an app. It contains the requested data, an acknowledgment of the action performed, and an appropriate status code.
* **Status Code:** A status code is a three-digit number returned by the server to indicate the outcome of an HTTP request. Common status codes include 200 (OK), 400 (Bad Request), 401 (Unauthorized), and 422 (Unprocessable Entity). [HTTP Status Codes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status)
* **Distribution Type:** Distribution Type refers to how an app is distributed or made available to GoHighLevel users. It can be either Agency or Sub Account. Agency distribution allows the app to be used by all locations within an agency account, while Sub Account distribution limits usage to specific sub-accounts or individual locations.
* **Location ID:** Location ID is a unique identifier assigned to a specific location within a GoHighLevel account. It is used to differentiate and manage access at the location level.
* **Company ID:** Company ID is a unique identifier assigned to a GoHighLevel company or account. It helps differentiate and manage access at the company level.
* **Hashed Company ID:** Hashed Company ID is a deprecated identifier that used to be associated with a GoHighLevel company or account. It is no longer in use and is being phased out.
* **Live Server:** Live Server refers to the actual production environment where the app interacts with GoHighLevel's API and real user data. It is the server where the app is deployed and accessible by users.
* **SDK (Software Development Kit):** An SDK is a set of tools, libraries, and documentation developers use to build applications for a specific platform or framework. GoHighLevel provides an SDK that facilitates the integration of custom apps with its API.
* **Authorization Header:** The Authorization Header is an HTTP header that includes authentication credentials in API requests, such as an Access Token. It typically takes the form "Authorization: Bearer {access\_token}". [Understand the Authorization Header](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Authorization)
* **API Key:** An API Key is a unique identifier or code provided to developers granting API access. It serves as a form of authentication when making API requests.
* **Callback URL**: A Callback URL is where an app expects to receive callbacks or responses. In the Developer's Marketplace context, the Callback URL is the endpoint that receives the authorization code or access token after the user grants permission during the OAuth process. [Learn more about Callback URLs](https://auth0.com/docs/flows/guides/auth-code/call-api-auth-code).
* **JSON (JavaScript Object Notation):** JSON is a lightweight data-interchange format that is easy for humans to read and write and for machines to parse and generate. It is commonly used for structuring data in API requests and responses. [Introduction to JSON](https://www.json.org/json-en.html)
* **Parameters:** Parameters are additional values included in an API request to provide specific instructions or filter the desired data. Parameters can be used to specify search criteria, sorting preferences, or pagination options. [Understanding API Parameters](https://apigee.com/about/blog/technology/restful-api-design-tips)
* **Pagination:** Pagination is dividing a large data set into smaller, more manageable parts called pages. API responses often include pagination information, such as the number of items per page and the total number of pages, allowing developers to retrieve data incrementally. [Implementing Pagination in APIs](https://www.moesif.com/blog/technical/api-design/REST-API-Design-Filtering-Sorting-and-Pagination/)
* **Rate Limiting:** Rate Limiting is a mechanism APIs use to restrict client or user's requests within a specific period. It helps maintain API performance and prevent abuse.
* **Webhooks:** Webhooks are HTTP callbacks or notifications sent from one application to another when a specific event or trigger occurs. In the Developer's Marketplace context, developers can configure webhooks to receive real-time updates or data from GoHighLevel, such as new leads or contact information.
* **Event:** An Event refers to a specific occurrence or action within an application or system. In the context of webhooks, events are triggers that prompt sending a webhook notification.
* **Request:** A Request is an HTTP message sent from a client (such as an application) to a server (such as an API) to initiate an action or retrieve data. It includes information such as the requested URL, method (GET, POST, etc.), headers, and optional body. [HTTP Request Methods](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/http/http%5Fmethods.htm)

## **What is the OAuth Flow in the Developer's Marketplace?**
  
  
The GitHub Repository mentioned in the video is accessible [here](https://github.com/GoHighLevel/oauth-demo).  
[Postman tool](https://www.postman.com/)  
[Gohighlevel Developers Marketplace](https://marketplace.gohighlevel.com/)  
[Gohighlevel Developers Community](https://developers.gohighlevel.com/)
  
  
The OAuth Flow in the Developer's Marketplace typically consists of the following steps:

  
**App Registration:** Developers register their applications on the Developer's Marketplace, providing necessary details and defining scopes. They receive a Client ID and a Client Secret, unique identifiers for their application.

  
**Authorization Request:** The application directs the user (usually via a browser) to the Marketplace's authorization server. The authorization request includes the Client ID, the requested scopes, and a redirect URL, a location in the application where users will be sent after authorization.

  
**User Consent:** The user logs into the Marketplace and reviews the application's request to access specific details (as defined by the scopes). If the user agrees, they are redirected to the provided redirect URL, with an authorization code appended as a query parameter.

  
**Authorization Grant:** The application receives the authorization code and verifies it. The application then makes a POST request to the authorization server, including the authorization code, Client ID, and Client Secret.

  
**Access Token Issuance:** If all the submitted details are correct and the authorization code is valid, the authorization server issues an access token to the application. The application can now use this access token to make requests to the API on behalf of the user, limited to the scopes defined earlier.

  
**API Call:** The application includes the access token in the header when making API calls. The server allows the requested operation if the access token is valid and has the necessary scopes.

  
**Token Refresh:** Access tokens have a limited lifetime and must be periodically refreshed using a refresh token (if provided by the authorization server). The application requests the server with the refresh token; a new access token is issued if it's valid.

  
Remember, OAuth is a delegation protocol, handy in scenarios where the application must act on users' behalf without requiring users' credentials. The actual flow might vary slightly based on the implementation of the Marketplace, but the basic principles remain the same.

  
### **Usage Cases:**

* **Managing Contacts:** Use the contact management APIs to create, update, search, and delete contacts, enabling efficient customer relationship management.
* **Conversations Management:** Implement the Conversations API to retrieve, update, and delete conversations, allowing for streamlined customer communication.

## **How to use the oAuth V2 to configure Webhooks for your apps?**

To configure webhooks for your application, follow these steps:

  
**Step 1: Sign up for a developer account**

  
Go to <https://marketplace.gohighlevel.com> and sign up for a developer account if you haven't already.

  
**Step 2: Create an app**

  
After signing in, go to "My Apps" and click "Create App" to create a new app.![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155000954523/original/4rcnI0ef-RPsMd4BvRJsuhjRyfMzxp-igA.png?1686657254)

  
**Step 3: Fill in the profile information**

  
Fill in all the required profile information for your app.

Make sure to mark the app as public.![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155000954537/original/sfF0EKyeKgckfy5gv3TgGqoLyGHGqJkszw.png?1686657271)

**App Name:**

The "App Name" refers to the name or title given to your application. It is a unique identifier representing your app within the developer marketplace and helps users quickly identify and distinguish it from other apps.

  
**App Type:** Public, Private:

The "App Type" determines the accessibility and visibility of your application.

  
Public App: A public app is available for anyone to use and access. It is listed in the developer marketplace and can be installed by users with the necessary permissions.

Private App: A private app is restricted to a specific group or individuals. It is not publicly listed in the Marketplace and requires an invitation or authorization to access and use.

**Distribution Type:** Agency, Sub Account:

The "Distribution Type" specifies how your app is distributed and made available to users.

Agency Distribution: If you choose the agency distribution type, your app will be accessible to all accounts. This means that all agency members or sub-accounts can install and use the app. All

Sub-Account Distribution: With the sub-account distribution type, your app is limited to a specific sub-account within your agency. Only users belonging to that particular sub-account can install and use the app.
  
  
**Step 4: Add scopes**

In the app settings, add the required scopes for your app.

Refer to the documentation (<https://highlevel.stoplight.io/docs/integrations/6444956c5219f-scopes>) to determine the necessary scopes.![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155000955075/original/NjM9mDNEjP_oLARqC9ao3H9QLeU97Bac3g.png?1686657579)

  
**Step 5: Generate client credentials**

  
Create a client key for your app.

Save the generated **Client ID** and **Client Secret**, as needed, in the next steps.![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155000955274/original/XK78Lie2AZp0S08t8bMnhO5q3nswtfCcVA.png?1686657683)

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155000955423/original/7hNFNga_hkQeL6RUkjrW0JKwfrEhTtaKMg.png?1686657716)  
**Step 6: Set up the OAuth endpoint**

  
Create a GET endpoint in your application that will handle the OAuth process.

Refer to the documentation [(https://highlevel.stoplight.io/docs/integrations/00d0c0ecaa369-get-access-token)](https://highlevel.stoplight.io/docs/integrations/00d0c0ecaa369-get-access-token) for more details on how to obtain the access token.

  
To create a GET endpoint for OAuth in your application:

  
* Choose a route for your endpoint (e.g., "/OAuth/callback/gohighlevel").
* Configure your application to listen for requests to this route.
* When a user authorizes your application, GoHighLevel will redirect them to your endpoint with a "code" parameter.
* Retrieve the "code" parameter from the request.
* Store the code securely.
* Make a POST request to GoHighLevel's "/OAuth/token" endpoint with the code, client ID, client secret, grant type, and redirect URI.
* Capture the response from the POST request.
* Extract the access token, token type, expiration time, refresh token, and other relevant information from the response.
* Store the access token securely in your application.

You can now use the access token to authenticate GoHighLevel API requests.

Following these steps, your GET endpoint will handle the OAuth process by exchanging the code for an access token and securely storing it for future API interactions.
  
  
**Step 7: Configure OAuth settings**

  
Set the OAuthToken Redirect URL in your app settings to the endpoint created in the previous step.![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155000956126/original/IV4iuW1RL5_6-izmCFYPybjm1jJP069HxA.png?1686657896)

  
**Step 8: Create a webhook endpoint**

  
Create a POST endpoint in your application to receive and process webhook events.

This endpoint should be able to handle the JSON body of the event.

  
**Step 9: Set up webhook URL**

  
Enter the URL of your webhook endpoint in the app settings.

  
**Step 10: Assign locations/accounts to your app**

  
Sign into an agency administrator account.

Open a new browser tab and go to your app in the Marketplace.

Click "+ Add App" and search for/select the desired account/location to add the webhook.

  
**Step 11: Retrieve the authorization code**

  
After successfully adding the app, you will be redirected to the Marketplace App page with an updated URL.

Copy the query string parameter "code" from the URL (e.g., code=c40216d8574eb90abe0c884058fa9f5101085exx).

  
**Step 12: Open a new browser tab**

  
Open a new browser tab and enter the following URL: YOUR\_REDIRECT\_URL?code=CODE

Replace YOUR\_REDIRECT\_URL with your app's redirect URL and CODE with the authorization code copied in the previous step.

  
**Step 13: Verify webhook connection**

  
If the response from <https://services.leadconnectorhq.com/oauth/token> was successful and you received the access token, the webhooks should now be connected.

  
By following these steps, you should be able to configure webhooks for your application and connect them to the desired accounts/locations. Refer to the documentation provided for detailed information on each step.
