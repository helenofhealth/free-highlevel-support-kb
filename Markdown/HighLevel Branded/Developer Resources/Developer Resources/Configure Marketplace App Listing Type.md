Configure Your App Listing Type for Visibility in Highlevel Accounts.

This can be selected while creating the app for the first time.  
  
**TABLE OF CONTENTS**

* [Type: Standard](#Type%3A-Standard)
* [Type: White-Label](#Type%3A-White-Label)

  
# Type: Standard

Standard apps are visible at both the agency and sub-account levels under the Highlevel domain, depending on their distribution type. These apps are not visible at the agency and sub-account levels under white-label domains.

  
# Type: White-Label

White-label apps are visible at the agency and sub-account levels under both white-label and non-white-label domains, according to their distribution type. These apps must not contain any references to Highlevel or Gohighlevel in their app properties, details, or on the company website. Any such references will result in disapproval during the app review process by the marketplace team.

  
Agencies and sub-accounts under white-label domains will only be able to install these apps. Given the nature of their type, white-label verified apps tend to have a broader reach as they are listed for both white-label and non-white-label agencies and sub-accounts. Therefore, it is recommended to fully white-label your app for maximum visibility.
