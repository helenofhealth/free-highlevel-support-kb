## **What is a Report Scheduler, and what benefits does it bring?**

Report Scheduler is a feature that helps Agency Owners schedule email reports for their clients daily, weekly, or monthly to help them track their performance and statistics (sub-accounts). It also tracks the post-report delivery activity.

  
The Report Scheduler offers several benefits for Agencies and their sub-account admins and users, making it a valuable tool for staying informed and empowered. These benefits include:

  
* Automation: The Report Scheduler automates sending reports, eliminating the need for manual intervention and saving time for businesses and their sub-account admins.
* Customization: Users can configure the frequency, date, and time for report delivery, ensuring that the recipients receive relevant and up-to-date information at the desired intervals.
* Consistent Updates: By sending reports on a daily, weekly, or monthly basis, sub-account admins and users stay informed about their account performance, allowing them to make data-driven decisions and track progress.
* Centralized Information: The Report Scheduler consolidates information from various dashboards, providing a comprehensive view of account performance in a single, easy-to-digest report.
* Improved Communication: By sending scheduled reports to sub-account admins and users, businesses foster better communication and collaboration within their teams, ensuring everyone is on the same page regarding account performance.
* Enhanced Engagement: Regularly receiving reports can help keep sub-account admins and users engaged with their accounts, encouraging them to stay proactive and take necessary actions to improve performance.
* Easy Monitoring: The Report Scheduler allows businesses to monitor post-report delivery activity, such as open rates and click-through rates, providing insights into how recipients engage with the reports and identifying areas for improvement.
