## **Components**

There are four (4) primary components of the Workflow Trigger - Instagram Comment(s) On A Post:

1. **Choose A Workflow Trigger:** By default this option is set to this trigger. You can change it to a different trigger if you want.
2. **Workflow Trigger Name:** By default this is just the name of the trigger. You can edit this to give it a clearer name that is visible in the Workflow.
3. **Filters:** This is where you select the criteria for firing the trigger in the right situation. More details in the next section.
4. **Track First Level Comments Only:** This toggle, when off, will allow the trigger to fire for all nested comments. When it is toggled on, then the trigger will only fire for the top (first) comment, not for comments under that comment.

### **Contains Phrase OR Exact Match**

###   

After you have identified the exact post, you can use either the Contains Phrase filter or the Exact Match filter.

  
* **Contains Phrase:** the trigger will fire if the body of the comment contains one of the exact text strings you provide.
* **Exact Match:** the trigger will fire if the entire body of the comment exactly matches one of the text strings you provide.
