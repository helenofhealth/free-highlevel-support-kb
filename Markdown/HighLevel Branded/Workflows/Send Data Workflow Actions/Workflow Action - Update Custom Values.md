## **Suggested Triggers**

  
* **Contact Tag Added:** When a new tag is added to a contact (e.g., "VIP", "High Priority"), you can update a related custom value to reflect the importance of that contact.  
   * **Example**: If the "VIP" tag is added, update the custom value for **Discount Rate** to offer a higher percentage.

  
* **Contact Updated:** Trigger the action when specific contact fields are updated. For example, if a customer’s preferences or contact information changes, you can update a corresponding custom value.  
   * **Example**: If the **Email Subscription** field is updated to "Subscribed", update a custom value **Email Frequency** to "Weekly".
  
  
**Form Submitted:** After a form submission, you can update custom values based on the data provided in the form.

* **Example**: A form submission triggers the workflow to update the custom value **Survey Score** or **Preferences**.
  
  
**Appointment Booked:** After an appointment is successfully booked, you can update custom values based on the type of appointment or other related criteria.

* **Example**: When a contact books a high-ticket appointment, update the **Appointment Importance** custom value to “High”.
  
  
**Opportunity Status Changed:** When the status of an opportunity changes in the pipeline (e.g., from "Qualified" to "Won"), you can update a custom value that helps manage customer expectations.

* **Example**: If the opportunity status changes to "Won", update the custom value **Client Tier** to "Platinum".
  
  
**Survey Submitted:** When a contact submits a survey, their responses can be used to dynamically update custom values that inform future interactions.

* **Example**: If a customer survey response indicates a high satisfaction score, update a custom value **Customer Satisfaction** to reflect that score.
  
  
**Order Fulfilled:** After an order is fulfilled, you can update the contact's custom value to track their order history or customer status.

* **Example**: When an order is fulfilled, update the custom value **Last Order Date** to the current date.
  
  
**Link Clicked:** When a contact clicks a link in an email or SMS, the workflow can dynamically update a custom value based on their behavior.

* **Example**: If a link for a new product is clicked, update a custom value **Product Interest** to reflect the interest in the clicked product.
