2. **Action**: Set the GMB action with a message like:  
   * **Message**: "Hello {{contact.name}}, this is a reminder for your upcoming appointment on {{appointment.date}}. If you have any questions, please let us know!"  
   * Use the `{}` icon to insert custom values like contact name and appointment date.

  
By setting up the action this way, you ensure that each contact receives a personalized reminder through Google My Business, making your interactions more meaningful and engaging.
