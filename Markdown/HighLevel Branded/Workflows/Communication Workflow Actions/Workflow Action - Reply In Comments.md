## **What Is Reply In Comments?**

  
In your Facebook or Instagram account there are comments on your post. Once a workflow has been triggered by one of these comments, you can use this action to reply to that comment with a comment underneath it. You can also like the comment.

  
Note that the Reply In Comments action must be used with a relevant trigger: [Facebook Comment(s) On A Post](https://help.gohighlevel.com/en/support/solutions/articles/155000004645) or [Instagram Comment(s) On A Post](https://help.gohighlevel.com/en/support/solutions/articles/155000004646).
