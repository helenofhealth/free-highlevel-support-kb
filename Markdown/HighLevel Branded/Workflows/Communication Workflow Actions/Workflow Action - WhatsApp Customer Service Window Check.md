## Overview

  
The WhatsApp Customer Service Window Check action allows you to check if a customer service window is open before sending free-form messages. When the window is open, businesses can send unlimited free-form messages for the first 1,000 service conversations each month at no additional cost. This feature ensures that you're utilizing the open window to communicate with customers effectively, avoiding additional costs.

  
## Action Name

  
WhatsApp Customer Service Window Check

  
## Action Description

The **WhatsApp Customer Service Window Check** action determines whether an active customer service window exists between your business and a customer. A customer service window is triggered when a customer sends a message to your business, lasting 24 hours. During this time, you can send unlimited free-form messages. If the window is closed, only pre-approved WhatsApp templates can be used to initiate a new conversation.

**Key Features:**

* Automatically checks if the 24-hour customer service window is open.
* Allows sending free-form messages when the window is open.
* Uses pre-approved templates to initiate conversations if the window is closed.
* Saves messaging costs by leveraging the 1,000 free service conversations per month.

  
## Action Details

##### **Step-by-Step Guide**

1. **Prerequisites:**  
   * Ensure WhatsApp is enabled on your HighLevel subaccount. If you want to send business-initiated messages, you must have an approved WhatsApp template. Follow the [WhatsApp Subaccount Setup](https://help.gohighlevel.com/a/solutions/articles/155000001980) and [How to Create a WhatsApp Template](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/155000000861-how-to-create-a-whatsapp-template) guides.
2. **Add the WhatsApp Customer Service Window Check:**  
   * Navigate to **Automations > Workflows > Create Workflow > Start from Scratch**.  
   * Add the **WhatsApp: Customer Service Window Check** action. This will create two branches: "Open" and "Closed."
3. **Configure the Open Branch:**  
   * Under the **Open** branch, select the **WhatsApp Send Message** action and choose **None - Free Form Message**.  
   * If the window is open, you can send free-form messages without any restrictions, taking advantage of the free tier of 1,000 conversations per month.
4. **Configure the Closed Branch:**  
   * Under the **Closed** branch, select the **WhatsApp Send Message** action and choose an approved **Marketing/Utility Template**.  
   * If the customer service window is closed (i.e., no customer response in the last 24 hours), you can only send pre-approved template messages to initiate a new conversation.
