## **Components - Buttons & Quick Replies**

##   

 The Buttons and Quick Replies are a big part of what makes this action "interactive". You can guide the conversation down pre-defined paths.Buttons and quick replies both create the same branches in a workflow. However, they serve slightly different purposes. 

  
**Buttons** are typically used for **persistent** actions and can perform tasks like redirecting to a link, opening a dialer, or triggering specific workflow branches. **They remain visible** even after the user interacts with them. You can add 3 buttons.

  
**Quick replies**, on the other hand, are designed to **guide** conversations by offering one-tap response options. They **disappear** after the user selects one, keeping the conversation focused and streamlined. You can add up to 13 quick replies.

  
In this Facebook Interactive Messenger action you can add Buttons, Quick Replies, and Files alongside each other in one action. In the Instagram Interactive Messenger you can either add buttons or Quick Replies in a message. Quick Replies can only be added when no attachments are included in the same message.
  
  
Components:

1. Button: text displayed in the conversation and the label in the workflow.
2. Button: action.  
    
   1. Open Website: add a url and when the user clicks it will open the url for them in a new tab, leaving the conversation unaffected, and the buttons stays active if they scroll back to it.  
   2. Call Number: add a phone number and when the user clicks it will open their dialer for them, leaving the conversation unaffected, and the button stays active if they scroll back to it.  
   3. Perform Action: no specific event, it just creates a workflow branch and goes to the next workflow action in that branch.
3. Quick Reply: label in the workflow.
4. Quick Reply: text displayed in the conversation.
5. Example Button branch.
6. Example Button branch with another Interactive Messenger action to deliver the checklist.
7. Another Interactive Messenger action to deliver the checklist.
