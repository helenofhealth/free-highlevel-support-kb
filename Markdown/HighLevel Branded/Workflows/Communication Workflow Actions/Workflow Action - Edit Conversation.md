## Example

**Scenario:** You want to ensure that conversations are archived and marked as read once a customer service issue is resolved.

1. Set up a workflow trigger for when a contact replies.
2. Add the "Edit Conversation" action.
3. Configure it to mark the conversation as read and archive it.
4. This way, all resolved conversations are automatically moved out of the active conversation list, helping your team stay organised and focused on unresolved issues.

  
This setup helps maintain a clean and organised communication channel, ensuring that only active and unresolved conversations are immediately visible to the support team.
