### **Set Up Filters**

  
Filters play a crucial role in refining when the Email Events Trigger activates, ensuring that your workflows are only triggered by relevant email interactions. The two primary filters—**Event** and **In Workflow**—allow you to define specific conditions under which the trigger should run.

#### **Event Filter**

####   

The Event Filter enables you to choose specific email events that will activate the trigger. These events represent key interactions or outcomes of your email campaigns. You can select one or multiple events depending on your workflow requirements.

  
Here’s a breakdown of the available events:

  
* **Clicked:** The trigger activates when a recipient clicks any link in the email.
* **Opened:** The trigger activates when an email is opened by the recipient.
* **Bounced:** The trigger activates when an email bounces (i.e., it couldn’t be delivered).
* **Unsubscribed:** The trigger activates when a recipient unsubscribes from your email list.
* **Complained (Spam):** This event triggers the workflow when a recipient marks your email as spam. This is a critical event to track, as it directly affects your email deliverability and sender reputation. When too many complaints are received, email service providers (ESPs) may start flagging your future emails as spam or even block your domain.

#### **In Workflow Filter**

  
The In Workflow Filter allows you to restrict the trigger to specific workflows. This filter ensures that the trigger only activates when the email event occurs within a designated workflow, adding another layer of precision to your automation.

**Trigger Setup:** Use the Email Events trigger with the event filter set to “Clicked” and the workflow filter set to “Consultation Promo.”

  
**Outcome:** When a lead clicks on the email link, a follow-up workflow is triggered, sending an email with a booking link and notifying the sales team for further engagement.

### **Use Case #2 Managing Bounced Emails**

  
**Scenario:** A marketing department wants to ensure that bounced emails are handled appropriately by removing invalid contacts.

  
**Trigger Setup:** Use the Email Events trigger with the event filter set to “Bounced.”

  
**Outcome:** When an email bounces, the contact is automatically tagged as “Invalid,” removed from active mailing lists, and added to a suppression list to prevent future email attempts.

### **Use Case #3 Re-Engaging Contacts After Email Opens**

  
**Scenario:** A business wants to re-engage customers who open a promotional email but take no further action.

  
**Trigger Setup:** Use the Email Events trigger with the event filter set to “Opened” and the workflow filter set to “Holiday Promo.”

  
**Outcome:** If a customer opens the email but doesn’t click on any links, the system waits a day and sends a follow-up email with a special discount offer to encourage engagement.
