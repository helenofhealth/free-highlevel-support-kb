### **Set Up Filters**

  
Use filters to define specific conditions for the trigger.

  
#### **Invoice Status**

  
The Invoice Status Filter allows you to define the specific status change that activates your workflow. This ensures that only relevant invoices trigger automated actions. Below is a detailed explanation of each status option:

  
* **Paid:** Triggers the workflow when an invoice is fully paid. This is useful for sending thank-you emails, updating CRM records, or notifying the finance team about completed payments.
* **Partially Paid:** Triggers the workflow when a partial payment is made on an invoice. This is helpful for businesses that allow installment payments and want to track partial settlements.
* **Sent:** Activates the workflow when an invoice is sent to a customer. This is useful for automating reminders, ensuring timely follow-ups, or logging the sent status in the CRM.
* **Viewed:** Triggers the workflow when the customer views the invoice. This is useful for tracking customer engagement and planning timely follow-ups.
* **Void:** Activates the workflow when an invoice is voided. This is particularly helpful for maintaining accurate financial records and ensuring no further reminders or actions are taken on canceled invoices.

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

  
**Q. Can I set up different actions for different invoice statuses?**

Yes, you can configure separate workflows for various statuses like Sent, Paid, Partially Paid, and Overdue. This allows you to tailor specific actions for each status.
  
  
**Q. How can I prevent duplicate reminders from being sent after payment?**

To avoid duplicate reminders, set up a secondary workflow triggered by the **“Paid”** status. This workflow should include an action to remove the contact from the initial reminder workflow.
  
  
**Q. Can I add multiple filters to a single trigger?**

Yes, you can add multiple filters, such as invoice status, tags, or custom fields, to refine the trigger conditions further.
  
  
**Q. Is it possible to notify different teams based on the invoice amount?**

Absolutely. By using filters and conditions, you can create workflows that send notifications to specific teams based on criteria like invoice amount or customer type.
  
  
**Q. How do I ensure that the workflow doesn’t send unnecessary reminders after the payment is made?**

Enable the **“Stop on Response”** option in the settings. This ensures that once the payment is made, the contact is removed from the workflow, preventing unnecessary follow-ups.
