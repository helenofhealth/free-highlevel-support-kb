## **Using Filters for Refund Trigger**

  
Filters give you control over exactly when the refund workflow will activate, ensuring it's only triggered by relevant refund scenarios. These filters can be used individually or stacked with each other to give you more control.  
  
* **Status:** Filter based on refund status  
    
   * Successful: Trigger only after a completed refund.  
   * Failed: Trigger when a refund attempt fails.
* **Amount:** Filter based on refund value  
    
   * Greater than, Less than, or Equal to a specific dollar amount (e.g., refund > $100)
* **Source:** Filter based on where the refund originated  
    
   * Options include Calendar, Communities, Payment Link, Invoices, Manual, and more.
* **Type:** Filter based on the type of refund  
    
   * Full Refund or Partial Refund

## **Adding Actions to the Refund Trigger Workflow**

  
After your trigger and filters are set, you can add various actions based on the desired outcome. These examples highlight common use cases.

  
Tip: Refund custom values are also available inside the Payments section in Custom Values. This allows you to send include specific refund details within your messages.
  
  
#### **Example 1:** Send a Confirmation Notification

#### 

A practical use case for the Refund Trigger is automating customer notifications. For instance, if a refund is processed successfully, an automated email can be sent to inform the customer of the successful transaction. Conversely, if a refund fails, a different automated message can be triggered to notify the customer of the issue and provide further instructions. This ensures timely communication and enhances customer satisfaction during potentially frustrating situations.

#### **Example 2:** Assign an Internal Task

Use the Refund Trigger to create a task for your support or success team to follow up with a customer who received a refund.

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

  
**Q: Can the Refund Trigger handle multiple refunds for the same contact?**  
Yes. Each refund instance is treated as a new trigger event. By default, each refund event (even for the same customer) will trigger the workflow again.  
  
**Q: Will this trigger if I refund through Stripe directly or another external provider?**  
No. The refund must be issued inside HighLevel for the trigger to fire. The payment processors supported in HighLevel are Stripe, Authorize.net and NMI. The integration must be set up and the refund must go through HighLevel in order for the trigger to fire.  
  
**Q: How do I use this trigger for partial refunds only?**  
Add a condition to the trigger for Refund Type = Partial. You can use multiple conditions (like Refund Type + Refund Failed) to filter events even more accurately.  
  
**Q: What happens if the refund fails?**  
The workflow can still fire based on the selected filters. Use the Refund Failed = True filter to manage cases where the refund fails. This is useful to notify team members of a failed refund.  
  
**Q: What if I want to notify internal teams instead of the customer?**  
You can use internal actions such as tasks or internal emails to notify internal teams of a refund.
