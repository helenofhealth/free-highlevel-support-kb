# **What is the Coupon Code Redeemed Workflow Trigger**

  
The Coupon Code Redeemed trigger fires when a coupon code is successfully redeemed in a completed transaction. Unlike the Coupon Code Applied trigger, which fires anytime a coupon is applied (regardless of whether transaction is completed or not), this trigger activates only when the order is finalized and payment is complete.

  
It’s an essential tool for marketing and sales teams who want to track actual coupon redemptions and take immediate, post-sale actions such as sending thank-you notes, tagging high-value customers, or triggering loyalty rewards.

* **VIP Segmentation:** Tag customers who redeem high‑value or exclusive coupons so you can nurture them with loyalty campaigns

  
* **Team Coordination:** Alert fulfillment, sales, or support teams in real time so high‑discount or limited‑edition orders get priority handling
* **Performance Monitoring:** Gather data on which coupon codes convert best and use that insight to refine future promotions
* **Operational Efficiency:** Automatically monitor redemption and trigger follow-ups without manual checks

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

  
**Q: Will this trigger fire if a coupon is applied but the order isn’t completed?**  
No, this trigger only fires when a coupon is successfully redeemed in a completed transaction. Use the **Coupon Code Applied** trigger to automate actions at the checkout stage.

  
**Q: Can I track which products the coupon was redeemed against?**  
Yes, use the **Product(s) in Order** and **Product Collection** filters to narrow down based on product selections at the time of coupon redemption.

  
**Q: What happens if I don’t apply any filters?**  
The workflow will trigger for every coupon redeemed in any completed transaction. It’s a good practice to use filters like **Coupon Code Is** or **Coupon Type** Is to target specific promotions.

  
**Q: Can I trigger actions based on the order value or coupon value?**  
Yes, you can use the **Order Value (Before Discount)** and **Coupon Value** filters with operators like **Greater Than** and **Less Than** to control when your workflow fires.

  
**Q: Can I monitor redemption limits automatically with this trigger?**  
Yes, use the **Redemption Count (per coupon)** filter to trigger actions when a coupon’s usage reaches a specific number.

**Q: What if multiple coupon are used in a single purchase?**

This trigger evaluates each coupon independently. Apply filters to target the specific code(s) you want the workflow to respond to.
