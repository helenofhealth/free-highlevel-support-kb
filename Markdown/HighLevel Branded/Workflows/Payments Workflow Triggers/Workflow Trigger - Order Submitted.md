# **What is the Order Submitted Workflow Trigger?**

  
The Order Submitted Trigger activates a workflow when an order is placed through an order form. Unlike basic order form triggers, this trigger captures both primary purchases and upsell transactions, making it ideal for:

* Sending order confirmation emails
* Automating upsell follow-ups
* Updating customer records with order details
* Segmenting customers based on purchase behavior

  
This trigger supports custom values, allowing businesses to dynamically reference product names, quantities, prices, and payment methods inside workflows.

### **Applying Filters**

  
Filters allow you to fine-tune your workflow trigger by specifying conditions based on order details. This helps ensure the automation runs only when certain criteria are met. 

  
Below are the available filters and their corresponding operators, allowing for precise customization to match your business needs.

  
#### **Global Product**

  
This filter allows you to trigger the workflow based on a specific product or price. You can choose to include or exclude a product by selecting **“Is”** or **“Is Not”** from the dropdown menu, ensuring the automation runs only for relevant purchases. This is useful for setting up targeted follow-ups or exclusive post-purchase actions for certain products.

  
* **Is:** Triggers the workflow only when the specified product is purchased.
* **Is Not:** Excludes the selected product, ensuring the workflow runs for all other products except the one specified.

#### **Order Source**

  
This filter allows you to determine where the order was placed, ensuring that the workflow triggers only for purchases from a specific source. The available options for selection include:
  
  
| **Filter Option** | **Description**                                                      |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| External          | Orders placed through an external integration or third-party system. |
| Form              | Orders submitted via a standard form (not an order form).            |
| Membership        | Purchases made for membership-based products.                        |
| Order Form        | Transactions processed through an order form.                        |
| Payment Link      | Orders completed via a direct payment link.                          |
| Store             | Purchases made from an online store.                                 |
| Survey            | Orders submitted through a survey form.                              |

* **Is Not:** Excludes the selected order source from triggering the workflow.

#### **Sub-Source**

  
This filter allows for a more granular refinement of the Order Source, helping businesses target specific funnels, pages, or other subcategories within the selected source. It ensures that workflows trigger only when an order is placed within a particular sub-environment of the main order source.

  
For example:

If Order Form is selected as the order source, the Sub-Source filter allows you to specify a particular funnel or website where the order form was submitted.

If Store is the order source, the Sub-Source filter can help identify a specific product category or store section where the purchase occurred.

  
Operators:

* **Is:** Triggers the workflow only when the order matches the selected sub-source.
* **Is Not:** Excludes orders from the selected sub-source.

#### **In Funnel/Website**

  
This filter ensures that workflows trigger only when an order form is submitted through a specific funnel or website, helping businesses refine automation based on the exact sales channel used. This is particularly useful for businesses that run multiple sales funnels or have different websites for various products or services.

  
For example:

If you sell products across multiple funnels, you can trigger a workflow only when an order is submitted within a specific funnel.

If you have different landing pages for different promotions, you can use this filter to trigger a workflow only when the order comes from a particular page within a funnel or website.

  
Operators available:

* **Is:** Workflow will trigger only if the order is submitted through the selected funnel or website.
* **Is Not:** Workflow will exclude orders from the selected funnel or website.

#### **Page Is**

  
This filter ensures that workflows trigger only when an order form is submitted on a specific page within a funnel or website. It allows businesses to create highly targeted automation based on the exact page where a customer completes a purchase.

  
For example:

If a business has multiple pages within a funnel (e.g., Checkout Page, Thank You Page, Upsell Page), this filter ensures that workflows only trigger when an order is submitted on a selected page, such as the Registration Form or Checkout Page.

  
If different order forms exist on various pages of a website, this filter can be used to limit workflow execution to a specific order page rather than all pages within a funnel or website.

  
Operators available:

* **Is:** The workflow will trigger only when the order is submitted on the selected page.
* **Is Not:** The workflow will exclude orders from the selected page.

#### **Submission Type**

  
This filter allows workflows to trigger based on the type of purchase made, helping businesses automate follow-ups and post-purchase actions accordingly. It ensures that workflows activate only when a specific type of transaction occurs.
  
  
| Operator | Description                                                                                                                                          |
| -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Primary  | Triggers when a customer purchases the main product at checkout. This is the initial product purchase made through an order form.                    |
| Bump     | Triggers when a bump offer is accepted during checkout. Bump offers are optional add-ons that customers can purchase along with the primary product. |
| Upsell   | Triggers when a post-checkout upsell is accepted. Upsells are additional offers presented after the initial purchase, often to increase order value. |
  
  
![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155041457552/original/FYpZwBGu8g7zoNf_bNGKc_3bPsa0vB6VTw.png?1739360381)
  
  
#### **Product Price**

  
This filter triggers workflows based on the specific price of a product, allowing businesses to differentiate actions based on standard pricing, discounts, or promotional rates. It ensures that workflows are activated only when a product is purchased at a designated price point.

  
Operators available:

* **Is:** Triggers the workflow when the product is purchased at a specific price set in the order form.
* **Is not:** Triggers the workflow when the product is purchased at any price other than the specified one.

### **Enable “Allow Multiple” (Best Practice for Upsells & Bumps)**

  
To ensure seamless automation for both primary purchases and upsells, it’s recommended to enable the Allow Multiple setting in workflow settings. This allows the workflow to trigger separately for each purchase event, including bump offers and upsells.
  
  
| When Allow Multiple is ON  | The workflow can trigger multiple times for the same contact, ensuring that both the primary purchase and any subsequent upsell purchases are processed independently. |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| When Allow Multiple is OFF | If the workflow is still active from the primary purchase, any upsell purchases made by the customer won’t trigger a new instance of the workflow.                     |
  
  
**Tip:** Keeping Allow Multiple **ON** prevents delays and ensures that upsell and bump offers trigger the workflow correctly, optimizing revenue opportunities and customer engagement.
