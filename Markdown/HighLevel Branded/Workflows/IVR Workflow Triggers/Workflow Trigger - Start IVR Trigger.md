## Overview

  
The "Start IVR Trigger" in HighLevel enables you to create and manage interactive voice response (IVR) systems within your workflows. This trigger allows you to initiate a multi-step voice menu that guides callers through various options, ensuring they reach the correct department or receive the desired information efficiently. Voicemail cannot be tracked using IVR trigger

  
## Trigger Name

  
Start IVR Trigger

  
## Trigger Description

  
The Start IVR Trigger is designed to launch an IVR sequence when a specified event occurs, such as an inbound call to your business to the IVR phone number. This trigger helps automate the routing of calls, allowing callers to interact with pre-recorded voice prompts and navigate through options using their phone keypad.

  
## How to Configure

  
**Step by Step Guide**

* **Choose the Action Type:** Select "Start IVR Trigger" from the list of available triggers.
* **Name Your Action:** Enter a descriptive name for the workflow trigger name, such as "Trigger IVR call".
* **Configure the trigger** to be activated by an inbound call and choose the phone number.
* **Add custom fields** in filters as required.
* **Save and Activate:** Save the trigger and activate it to start using the IVR system for inbound calls.

  
**Note** : Once a phone number is mapped to a IVR workflow it cannot be mapped to any other IVR workflow

## Example

  
**Scenario:** You want to set up an IVR system that directs callers to the correct department within your company.

1. **Create Workflow Trigger:**  
   * Set the "Start IVR" trigger to activate when any inbound call is received on your main business line.
2. **Choose Tigger name and filters.**
3. **Within the Filters,** add an inbound phone number for which the IVR will get activated.
4. **Save and Activate:**  
   * Finalize your IVR setup and activate the workflow. Now, any inbound calls will trigger the IVR system.
