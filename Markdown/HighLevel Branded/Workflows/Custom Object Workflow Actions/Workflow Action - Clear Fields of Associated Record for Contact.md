## Overview

The **Clear Fields of an Associated Record** action allows users to reset specific fields within a custom object associated with a contact. This is useful for clearing outdated information, resetting form entries, or handling special conditions in workflows.

  
## Action Name

**Clear Fields of Associated Record for Contact**

  
## Action Description  
![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155041054690/original/EJDSgBhbWPet8kBhbbJeTCWWriARecUORQ.jpeg?1738756190)

This action lets users select specific fields within a custom object and clear their values while keeping the record intact. The [associated label ](https://help.gohighlevel.com/a/solutions/articles/155000004033?portalId=48000045315)determines which records should have their fields cleared.

  
## Action Details

* This action is possible only after creating custom objects in the subaccount and creating an association label between at least one of those objects and contacts.
* Needs at least [one association](https://help.gohighlevel.com/a/solutions/articles/155000004033?portalId=48000045315) between the custom object and the contact for the action to work
* Users can select multiple fields to be reset.
* The action does **not delete** the record, only the selected fields.

  
## Example

  
A retail business tracks **customer loyalty points** using a **Loyalty Program** custom object. When a customer redeems their points for rewards, the **Loyalty Points** field should be cleared to reflect the redemption.

Since workflows cannot trigger on specific dates, this action will be executed when a related **event occurs**, such as when a **redemption request is processed**.

#### **Example Setup**

1. **Object to Update** → Loyalty Program
2. **Association Label** → Customer Rewards
3. **Fields to Clear:**  
   * **Loyalty Points**  
   * **Last Redemption Date**

#### **How It Works**

* When a **customer redeems their points**, a workflow is triggered to **clear the Loyalty Points** field.
* The **Last Redemption Date** is also reset, ensuring accurate tracking of future redemptions.
* This prevents redeemed points from being mistakenly available for reuse while keeping the customer’s loyalty record intact.

This helps businesses **accurately track loyalty redemptions** and ensure that customers cannot reuse points after redemption.
