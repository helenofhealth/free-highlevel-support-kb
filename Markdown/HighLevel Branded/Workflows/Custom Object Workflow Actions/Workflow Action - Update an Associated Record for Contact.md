### **Example: Tracking Remaining Slots for a Trip**

A home appliance company sells products with warranties, and each product has a **Warranty** custom object to track:

* **Warranty Start Date**
* **Warranty Expiry Date**
* **Service History**

When a product is purchased, the **Warranty Start Date** should be set automatically, and when a warranty claim is made, the **Service History** field should be updated.

#### **Example Setup** (For updating warranty information after a service request)

1. **Object to Update** → Warranty
2. **Association Label** → Purchased Product
3. **Fields to Update:**  
   * **Service History** → Append service details  
   * **Last Service Date** → Set to today’s date

#### **How It Works**

* When a product is purchased, the **Warranty Start Date** is set via the **Create an Associated Record** action.
* If a customer submits a service request, the workflow triggers an **Update Associated Record**action:  
   * The **Service History** field is updated with details of the service performed.  
   * The **Last Service Date** is set to today’s date.

This helps the company maintain an updated service record for each product, ensuring smooth warranty tracking and claims processing.
