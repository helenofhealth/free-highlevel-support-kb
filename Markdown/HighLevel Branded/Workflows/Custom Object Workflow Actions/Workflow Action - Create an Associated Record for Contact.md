## Overview

  
The **Create an Associated Record** action in Contact-based workflows allows users to create a new custom object record and associate it with a contact. This feature is useful when managing related entities such as properties, contracts, or any other custom object tied to a contact.

  
## Action Name

**Create Associated Record for Contact**

  
## Action Description

  
![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155041052361/original/3dCs8bbLAWbHlPfWuwNbASA2jKu2OBKKfg.png?1738754630)This action enables users to create a new custom object record directly from a workflow and associate it with a contact. The available objects for creation depend on the custom objects configured within the sub-account.

  
## Action Details

* This action is possible only after creating custom objects in the subaccount and creating an association label between at least one of those objects and contacts.
* It allows defining multiple fields for the new object record.
* Users can specify an **[association label ](https://help.gohighlevel.com/a/solutions/articles/155000004033?portalId=48000045315)**to categorize the relationship between the contact and the custom object.
* The newly created record is automatically linked to the contact using the selected label.
* Users can also use custom value and custom fields - merge fields to add the information to the object

  
## Example

A solar company needs to track crucial dates for installations, such as:

* **Site Survey Date**
* **Install Date**

When an **Opportunity** is marked as "Won," the system should **automatically create an "Install" custom object record** for tracking these dates.

  
**Example Setup:**

1. **Object Record to Create** → Install
2. **Fields:**  
   * **Site Survey Date** → Auto-filled with today’s date  
   * **Install Date** → Auto-filled based on scheduling
3. **Association Label** → Installation Scheduled

When triggered, the workflow creates an **Install** record and links it to the contact for seamless tracking.
