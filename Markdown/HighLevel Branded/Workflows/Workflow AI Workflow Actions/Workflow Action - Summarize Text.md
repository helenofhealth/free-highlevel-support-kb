The Summarize Text action uses AI to automatically condense long content into concise summaries. Simply specify your desired summary length and input text, and the action will generate a shortened version while preserving key information.
  
  
# **How It Works**

  
The action processes your input text through AI to:

1. Identify key points and main ideas
2. Remove redundant information
3. Restructure content to fit your specified length
4. Maintain context and readability
