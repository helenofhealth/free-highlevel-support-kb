# **What is Intent Detection?**

The Intent Detection action is an AI-powered workflow tool that automatically analyzes text input to determine the underlying sentiment or intent. It processes any text—whether from customer messages, survey responses, or form submissions—and categorizes it into three distinct branches:  
  
* **POSITIVE**: Text expressing positive sentiment, satisfaction, or agreement
* **NEGATIVE**: Text conveying negative sentiment, dissatisfaction, or disagreement
* **NONE**: Text with neutral sentiment or when the system cannot confidently categorize it

This action creates three workflow branches automatically, allowing you to build different automation paths based on the detected sentiment.
