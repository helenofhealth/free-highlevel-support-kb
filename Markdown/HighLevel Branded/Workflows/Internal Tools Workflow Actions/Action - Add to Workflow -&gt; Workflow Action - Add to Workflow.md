# **What is the “Add to Workflow” Action?**

The **“Add to Workflow”** action is an automation tool that allows you to automatically add contacts to another specified workflow. This action is often used to move contacts between different stages of a customer journey or process, ensuring they are guided through the appropriate steps at the right time. Additionally, the Pass Input Trigger Parameters option allows you to carry data from the original workflow trigger into the new workflow, allowing for more personalized automation.

  
For example, after a customer books an appointment, you may want to automatically add them to an “Appointment Follow-Up” workflow that provides confirmation details and reminders before their appointment.

## **FAQs**

  
**Q1: Can I add a contact to multiple workflows simultaneously?**

No, the “Add to Workflow” action adds a contact to one workflow at a time. However, you can configure multiple “Add to Workflow” actions in your automation to achieve this.

  
**Q2: What happens if I enable “Pass Input Trigger Parameters”?**

When enabled, this option transfers data from the initial trigger (like contact details, date of booking, etc.) into the new workflow. This allows you to personalize subsequent actions in the new workflow.

  
**Q3: Can I remove a contact from the previous workflow after adding them to a new one?**

No, the “Add to Workflow” action does not remove contacts from previous workflows. If you need to remove a contact from a workflow, you must configure a “Remove from Workflow” action separately.

  
**Q4:** **How do I know if “Pass Input Trigger Parameters” is working correctly?**

You can test your workflow before activating it. Run a test to ensure the data is being transferred as expected.

  
**Q5: When using the “Add to Workflow” action, what trigger should I use to start the next workflow?**

You don’t need to manually set a trigger for the workflow that receives contacts via the “Add to Workflow” action. The system automatically enrolls the contact into the next workflow at the point where the workflow begins—no additional trigger is required. Simply design the new workflow with the assumption that contacts will be added by automation, and start the workflow with your desired first action (e.g., Send Email, Wait, Create/Update Opportunity, etc.). If you enable “Pass Input Trigger Parameters,” you can also personalize those next steps using data from the original workflow.
