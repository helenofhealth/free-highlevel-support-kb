# **What Is the “Wait” Action?**

  
The “Wait” action **holds a contact in the workflow** for:

  
 • A specified **amount of time** (e.g., 1 day, 1 hour, etc.).  
  
 • Until a **condition** is met (e.g., a contact replies or a specific event occurs).

## **When Should You Use the “Wait” Action?**

  
The “Wait” action is useful in scenarios where:

  
* **Timely Follow-ups**: Quickly respond to customer enquiries or send an email or SMS at appropriate time.
* **Conditional Triggers**: Hold a contact until a certain condition is met, such as completing a form or making a payment.
* **Controlled Scheduling**: Avoid sending messages during off-hours or weekends by resuming the workflow during specified times.

## **Configuring the “Wait” Action**

  
Here’s how you can set up the “Wait” action in your workflow:  
  
Step 1: Add the “Wait” Action to Your Workflow. Go to the "Workflows" area in "Automation" section.

  
![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155037447851/original/Lxb6k2u8rpcJLYQbYTc4A_lDYWHpQn137g.png?1732872616)
  
  
Step 2: Click " + Create Workflow" button at the top right corner. It will open a dropdown menu. Click " + Start from scratch" option.

  
![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155037449214/original/viFqQbtsDaoyZ6LLRJmrH-NyY2ulXi5LYg.png?1732873492)
  
  
Step 3: Set up the Trigger for the workflow. In this example, we have used "Contact created" trigger.

Step 4: To add the "Wait" step, click the "+" icon. from the actions menu, scroll down or search for "Wait" action.

Step 5: Name the Action: Provide a descriptive name (e.g., “Wait - 1 Day After Sign-Up”). This helps you identify the action easily when reviewing the workflow.

Step 6: Choose the Wait Type Click the dropdown to view and select the type of wait action based on your objective.

Step 7a: Time Delay: Specify a fixed duration to wait (e.g., 1 day, 1 hour, 5 minutes).

  
![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155037467551/original/DVi2ajFn44BLkt64A8BVBhgghyfMXIA93Q.jpeg?1732886751)

  
![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155037550216/original/vv8JqdbyYiXjAgBuDLUnlTqig_5Eb47MQA.png?1733126248)
  
  
Step 7b: Condition: Set a condition to resume the workflow. In the below example, we have added a condition that the workflow should be fired only if the answer to the question is "Yes"

  
![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155037470781/original/tsCSvH_Ix_-6ApRCsjTz2YWZ8iI_8YtDsw.png?1732889265)
  
  
**Conditions and Segments**  
  
When you select Wait for **Condition**, you’ll need to define **Conditions** that determine when the contact can proceed. You can group multiple conditions into **Segments**, using AND/OR logic to build more complex rules. If **any segment** evaluates as true, the Wait action is satisfied.  
  
Use **Add Condition** to build individual rules, and **Add Segment** to create grouped logic blocks.

Step 7c: Contact Reply. Pause until the contact interacts with your email or message.

Step 7d: Set Advance Window (optional). Use these settings to control the windows of days/times the Wait action will try to activate. For example, if the contact replied on a Saturday, and that would normally trigger the Wait action to proceed, but you only want it to run on weekdays, then you can set the Advance Window to Mon-Fri (excluding Sat-Sun). You can do the same for the times of day.

Step 7e: Resume On. Choose specific days to resume the action (e.g., weekdays only).

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155037466836/original/vyMu0xTNnDk8_rcGK8t-XNfw5TUURDGa3Q.jpeg?1732886235)
  
  
Step 7f: Resume Between Hours. Define the time window for resuming the action (e.g., 9 AM to 5 PM).

  
![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155037467210/original/CLCvJGXUPSDoJnFkuj48AYaCnBYn7ZYD6Q.jpeg?1732886567)
  
  
Step 7g: Additional Filters. Add more granular conditions, such as holding a contact until a specific year, months and date to fire some personalized workflows such as sending birthday wish on a specific date of the year.

Step 8: Save and Test. Save the workflow and test it to ensure the “Wait” action performs as expected.

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

  
**Q: What’s the difference between Segments and Conditions in a Wait action? How should I use them?**

  
In a Wait action, Conditions are individual rules like “Contact’s Job Title is CEO” or “Contact is in the ‘High-Value’ Tag.” Segments are groups of these conditions, evaluated together using AND/OR logic. A contact exits the Wait step when any one segment is satisfied.

  
For example, you may want the workflow to continue if a contact is highly engaged or meets specific criteria. Segment 1 might check if the contact opened a proposal email and is a “Decision-Maker,” while Segment 2 checks if they attended a strategy call and have an approved budget. 

  
If either segment is satisfied, the wait ends—allowing your automation to adapt to different but equally qualified user behaviors.
