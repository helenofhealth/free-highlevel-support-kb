## Overview

The **Gather Input On Call** action enables users to gather inputs via keypad from the caller. This can be used in IVR systems where the caller is prompted to press certain keys to make a selection (e.g., "Press 1 to speak to support, Press 2 to leave a message"). This action helps automate responses and proceed based on the inputs from the user.

  
## Action Name

**Gather Input On Call**

  
## Action Description

The **Gather Input On Call (IVR)** action collects information from the caller through DTMF (Dual Tone Multi-Frequency) inputs. It is typically used in IVR flows, where the user interacts with the system by pressing keys on their phone. Based on the keypress, different branches can be defined, allowing for customized flows depending on the input.
