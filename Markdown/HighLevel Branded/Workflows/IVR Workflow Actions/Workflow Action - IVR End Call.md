## Overview

The **End Call (IVR)** action allows the IVR system to immediately disconnect a call. Alternatively, you can choose to play a final message or custom audio before ending the call. This is useful when you want to wrap up an IVR interaction or provide an informational message before disconnecting.

## Example

**Scenario**: At the end of a customer service call, you want to confirm that the system is going to disconnect and thank the customer for their call.

* **Action Name**: End IVR Call
* **Add Voice Instructions**: Enabled
* **Say or Play Message**: Say a message
* **Text to Say**: "Thank you for calling ABC Services. Your call will now end."
* **Language**: English (US)
* **Message Voice**: Woman
* **Number of Loops**: 1

When configured, the system will play the message and then disconnect the call automatically.

###   

## Additional Notes:

* If **Add Voice Instructions** is disabled, the call will end immediately without any final message.
* Using text-to-speech can be effective for providing dynamic, real-time information before ending a call.
