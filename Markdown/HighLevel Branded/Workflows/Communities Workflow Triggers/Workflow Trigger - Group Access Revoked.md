## Overview

Group Access Revoked trigger in GoHighLevel workflows automates the process of managing group access within a community, allowing you to revoke access when necessary and streamline community interactions.  
  
## Trigger Name

Group Access Revoked

  
## Trigger Description

The "Group Access Revoked" trigger activates when a user's access to a specific group within a community is revoked. This allows for automated notifications and actions to inform users of changes to their group access.

  
## How to Configure

1. **Navigate to the Workflow Builder**: Access the Workflow Builder in your GoHighLevel account.
2. **Create a New Workflow**:  
   * Click on "Create a Workflow."  
   * Select the relevant trigger type: "Group Access Revoked."
3. **Configure Trigger Details**:  
   * Specify which group access is being revoked.  
   * Add any subsequent actions you wish to automate (e.g., sending notifications or updating user records).
4. **Test Your Workflow**: Ensure that the workflow operates as expected by testing it in a controlled environment.
5. **Save and Activate**: Once confirmed, save your workflow and activate it for use.

## Example

  
For instance, if a user violates the community guidelines in a professional networking group, you can set up a workflow that automatically revokes their access to the "Job Postings" group. This ensures they no longer receive updates about job opportunities and can no longer post their own job listings.
