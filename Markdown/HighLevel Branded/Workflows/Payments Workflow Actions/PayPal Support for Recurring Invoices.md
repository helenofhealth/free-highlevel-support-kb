## **Frequently Asked Questions**

  
**Q: What is the “Order Submitted” trigger used for?**

The “Order Submitted” trigger is used in Workflows to initiate automated actions when a customer completes a purchase. This includes one-time product orders and recurring invoice subscriptions. It helps streamline post-purchase processes like confirmation emails, internal notifications, or upsell flows.

  
**Q: Does the “Order Submitted” trigger work with PayPal?**

Yes, the trigger now fully supports PayPal transactions, including those involving recurring invoices. Once a user completes a PayPal checkout, the trigger will activate just like it does for Stripe transactions.

  
**Q: Can I use the trigger for both one-time and recurring purchases?**

Absolutely. The “Order Submitted” trigger works with both one-time product purchases and recurring invoice setups. You can differentiate between the two using filters in your workflow configuration.

  
**Q: How can I identify if the order was paid via PayPal or Stripe?**

You can use the “Payment Mode” filter within the workflow trigger to distinguish between PayPal and Stripe payments. This allows you to create customized automations based on the payment method used.

  
**Q: Will the trigger activate for failed PayPal payments or only successful ones?**

The “Order Submitted” trigger only fires after a **successful** order submission and payment confirmation—whether it’s via Stripe or PayPal. Failed or incomplete payments will not activate the trigger.
