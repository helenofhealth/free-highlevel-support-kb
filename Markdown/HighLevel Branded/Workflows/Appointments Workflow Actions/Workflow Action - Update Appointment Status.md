## Overview

The "**Update Appointment Status**" action changes the status of an appointment associated with the contact in the workflow. This action can update an appointment to a new status, such as confirmed, cancelled, or showed. If the workflow was triggered by an appointment-related event (like "Appointment" or "Customer Book Appointment"), it will automatically update the status of the appointment that triggered the workflow. Otherwise, it will update the most recent appointment for that contact.

Alternatively, if a customer showed up for their scheduled appointment, the status can be updated to "Showed" to reflect that the appointment was attended.
