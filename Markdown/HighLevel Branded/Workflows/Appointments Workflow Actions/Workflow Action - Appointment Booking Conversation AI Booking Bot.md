## Example

Imagine a scenario where you want to book a consultation appointment using the bot. You set the bot to act friendly and persuasive, guiding the contact towards scheduling their consultation. If the user does not respond within 24 hours (as per the timeout), the bot stops the conversation and marks the appointment as "not booked."

## Additional Notes

* Ensure that the bot’s personality is aligned with your business's tone and audience.
* Setting a higher message limit allows for longer conversations, but it can also result in slower resolution.
* If the contact does not respond in the allotted time, the appointment will be considered "not booked," and the workflow will proceed accordingly.
