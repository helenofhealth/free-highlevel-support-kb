# **What is Remove** **Assigned User**

  
The Remove Assigned User action is designed to unassign a CRM user from a contact, effectively leaving the contact unassigned. This action is particularly useful when a contact’s status or workflow criteria change, and they no longer need direct user assignment. By removing the assigned user, the contact can re-enter other workflows or remain unallocated for future processing.

## **Key Benefits of Using This Workflow Action**

* **Automated Workflow Management:** Seamlessly removes user assignments when specific triggers (like task completion or status changes) occur, eliminating manual intervention.
* **Improved User Availability:** Frees up users by removing contacts that no longer require their direct attention.
* **Enhanced Workflow Flexibility:** Allows contacts to move between workflows without conflicting or outdated assignments.

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

  
**What happens to a contact after the assigned user is removed?**

Once the assigned user is removed, the contact becomes unassigned and remains in the system without an active user assignment. It can then be reassigned through other workflows or triggers.

  
**Can this action be combined with multiple triggers in a single workflow?**

Yes, you can combine the Remove Assigned User action with multiple triggers, such as “Task Completed” and “Opportunity Status Changed,” to create complex workflows that dynamically manage contact assignments.

  
**Will this action remove the assignment history?**

No, removing an assigned user does not erase the contact’s assignment history. You can still track previous user assignments through activity logs or reporting tools.

  
**How do I ensure this action doesn’t interrupt other workflows?**

To prevent conflicts, test the workflow before publishing it and review conditions for all triggers carefully. Ensure the Remove Assigned User action is only applied where necessary.

  
**Can I reassign a contact immediately after using the Remove Assigned User action?**

Yes, after removing the current assignment, you can add a follow-up action in the workflow to reassign the contact to a new user using the “Assign to User” action.
