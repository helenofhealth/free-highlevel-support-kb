What is "First" or "Latest" Attribution?  
When attributing a contact to a specific source it is common to consider the first and latest attribution. Both are always stored on every single contact.  
  
First Attribution - is the first time a contact interacts with our system, when this happens we record attribution data for that session. For example: Someone fills out a form.  
  
  
Latest Attribution - is the most recent recorded interaction with us, when this happens we record attribution data for this most recent session as well. For example: After filling out a form they then decide to purchase our product via a Two-Step Order Form. When this happens, the latest attribution data will be recorded.  
  
  
\*The latest attribution will always change based on the last recorded interaction. However, the first attribution will not.
