## Example

**Scenario:** A customer has opted out of receiving promotional SMS but wants to stay updated via email.

1. Set up a workflow trigger when a contact opts out of SMS communication.
2. Add the "DND Contact" action.
3. Configure it to enable DND for SMS only while keeping other channels active.
4. This setup ensures the contact will not receive SMS notifications but can still receive updates via email or other preferred channels.

This approach respects customer preferences and helps maintain a positive relationship by avoiding unwanted communications.
