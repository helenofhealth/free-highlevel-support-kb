# **What Is the Workflow Pro Plan?**

  
The Workflow Pro Plan is an add‑on subscription specifically for managing premium workflow triggers and actions. It sits alongside your main GoHighLevel plan (such as Agency Pro or Agency Unlimited) and handles only the extra‑cost executions. With Workflow Pro, agencies can bulk‑purchase premium triggers and actions at a discounted rate, then resell or allocate those executions to their sub‑accounts. This separation ensures that your core platform features (CRM, website builders, base automation workflows) remain on your primary plan, while all premium workflow costs are consolidated and controlled through the Pro add‑on.

## **Key Benefits of Workflow Pro Plan**

  
* **Bulk Savings:** pre‑purchase 10,000 premium executions at a lower per‑action rate.
* **Resale Flexibility:** agencies on Pro or Unlimited plans can mark up and resell executions to sub‑accounts.
* **Predictable Costs** **:** one monthly fee covers your premium workflow usage up to the plan limit.
* **Transparent Overages:** extra executions are billed at a clear $0.01 per action after the plan’s allowance.
* **Simplified Billing:** all premium trigger and action costs live in one pack, separate from your core subscription.
