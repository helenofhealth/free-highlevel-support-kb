# **What Are Nested Folders?**

  
You can create folders to hold workflows. You can also hold folders inside of folders. We call this "nesting" the folders. You can have multiple levels of folders creating a hierarchy of workflows. This "tree" organization makes it much easier to scale than a simple "flat" list of all workflows. We will cover how to create and use nested folders, set permissions, and follow best practices for optimal organization.

## **Creating and Managing Nested Folders**

  
**Step 1:** Navigate to Workflows

**Step 2:** Create a new folder

In the Workflows section click the Create Folder button, type the name of the new folder, and click save.

**Step 3:** Create a nested folder

To create a nested folder simply click into a folder to open it and then click Create Folder and follow the same steps. The new folder will be nested inside the existing folder.

**Step 4a:** Move a workflow/folder to another folder - Workflow List

Navigate to the workflow/folder you want to move and click the three dots menu on the right-hand side of the line. Then click Move To Folder in the menu that appears.

**Step 4b:** Move a workflow/folder to another folder - Move Menu

After clicking Move to Folder a new modal will appear on top of the window. Navigate to the target folder, select it, and click Move Here. Or use the New Folder button to create the folder you want.

**Step 5a:** Rename a workflow/folder - Workflow List

To change the name of a folder, first navigate to the folder, and then click the three dot menu, then click Rename Folder.

**Step 5b:** Rename a workflow/folder - Rename Modal

Once you've clicked Rename Folder, just type the new name into the field and click save.

**Step 6:** Delete a folder

If you no longer want a folder, you can delete it. It's easy, you just click the three dot menu next to the folder and click Delete Folder. When you're ready, click Delete.

  
Deleting a folder WILL NOT delete the folders and workflows inside of it. They will all be moved up a level.

## **Permissions for Nested Folders**

  
Proper permission management is critical when organizing workflows within nested folders. GoHighLevel offers robust controls to ensure team members have appropriate access.

###   

1. **Role-Based Access:** Permissions to view, edit, or manage folders depend on the userâ€™s role (e.g., Admin, Sub-User).  
   * Admin users have full control, including creating, deleting, and moving folders.  
   * Sub-users may have restricted access based on settings configured by the admin.
2. **Inherited Permissions:**  
   * Nested folders typically inherit permissions from their parent folder.  
   * Users can customize permissions at the individual folder level if necessary.
3. **View-Only vs. Full Control:**  
   * Users can be assigned **view-only access** (for monitoring workflows without making changes) or **full control** (for creating and editing workflows).
4. **Collaboration Considerations:**  
   * When collaborating on workflows, ensure that only authorized users have access to critical workflows within folders.  
   * Shared permissions prevent unauthorized modifications and accidental deletions.
5. **Implications of Moving or Deleting a Folder:**  
   * When a folder is moved, its permissions may be retained or adjusted based on the new location.  
   * Deleting a folder will remove its contents unless workflows are reassigned to another folder.

  
For detailed instructions, refer to the [Workflow Folder Permission article](https://help.gohighlevel.com/en/support/solutions/articles/48001219648).

## **Best Practices for Using Nested Folders**

  
To make the most out of nested folders, consider these organizational tips:

  
* **Group Workflows by Purpose:** Create top-level folders for broad categories such as Marketing Campaigns, Client Projects, or Internal Processes. Use nested folders within these categories to further separate workflows by campaign, client, or phase.
* **Limit Folder Depth:** Avoid creating excessively deep folder structures, as this can make it harder to locate workflows quickly. A maximum of 2-3 levels is recommended.
* **Set Permissions Strategically:** For sensitive or high-impact workflows, use restricted permissions to limit access to only key team members.
* **Regularly Audit Folder Organization:** Periodically review folder structures to ensure they remain relevant and efficient. Archive or delete unused workflows and folders as needed.
* **Leverage Search and Filters:** If your folder structure becomes large, use the search and filter options within GoHighLevel to quickly locate specific workflows.

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

  
**Q: What happens if I delete a nested folder?**

A: Deleting a folder will move all of the folders and files inside it up a level.

  
**Q: Can I share specific folders with external users or clients?**

A: Folder sharing is limited to internal users with the appropriate permissions.

  
**Q: Are there any limitations on how many folders I can create?**

A: There is no fixed limit, but we recommend keeping the structure manageable for ease of access and maintenance.
