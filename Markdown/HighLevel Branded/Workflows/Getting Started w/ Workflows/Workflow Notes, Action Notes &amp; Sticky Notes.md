## **Workflow-Level Notes**

  
### **Overview**

* These notes are visible to all users, ensuring everyone involved in the workflow has the same understanding. Workflow Notes allow users to add comments or descriptions at the workflow level, providing context or additional instructions for team members. This is particularly useful when sharing workflows across teams or automating complex processes where clarity is important.

  
### **Who Can Add Notes**:

* Admins can now add notes specific to each workflow.

  
### **How to Use**:

* Click the **"Notes"** icon from the sidebar while inside a workflow to open the notes panel.
* Add your notes to provide descriptions, context, or instructions relevant to the entire workflow.

  
### **Saving the Notes**:

* The notes will be saved automatically when the workflow is saved, ensuring that no information is lost.

  
### **Tracking**:

* Each note will display **Created by**, **Edited by**, **Created on**, and **Edited on** information, allowing for full transparency about who added or changed the notes and when.

## **Action-Level Notes (Formerly Known as Comments)**

  
### **Overview**

* Action Notes allow users to attach notes to individual actions within a workflow, offering more detailed commentary on specific steps. This is useful when there’s a need to explain the purpose or special conditions of an action, ensuring everyone on the team understands the intent behind it.

  
### **Who Can Add Notes**:

* Every user has the capability to add action "Action Notes".

  
### **How to use**:

* When hovering over any action in a workflow, users will see a **notes icon** in the top-right corner of the action. Clicking it allows them to add action-specific notes.

  
### **Visibility**:

* Once a note is added to an action, the notes icon remains permanently visible, signaling that additional context or instructions are associated with that action.

  
### **History Tracking**:

* Each note keeps a **history of additions**, allowing teams to track discussions, updates, and feedback specific to that action.

  
### **Centralized Notes View**:

* All action-level notes can also be viewed and searched within the main **Notes** section. This creates a central location for tracking all notes associated with a workflow, making it easy to review and manage them.

## **Sticky Notes:**

  
### **Overview:**

###   

### **How to use**:

### **Customization Options**:

* Sticky Notes are highly customizable. Users can click the **Sticky Notes** icon to create notes with different colors, helping differentiate between various categories or types of tasks.

### **Rich Text Editor**:

* A rich text editor is available for formatting text, making it easier to emphasize key points or structure your notes.

  
### **Attach Images**:

* You can also attach images to Sticky Notes, making them more visually informative or detailed.

  
### **Visibility Controls**:

* You can toggle the visibility of sticky notes by clicking the **"Hide Notes"** button. This allows users to decide if they want notes to be visible at all times or only when needed.
