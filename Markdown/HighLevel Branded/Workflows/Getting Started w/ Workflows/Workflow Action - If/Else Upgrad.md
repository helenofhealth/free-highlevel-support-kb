### **Overview**

  
If/Else action is one of the most powerful action that gives users a lot of flexibility in workflows. We have made significant changes in the action to make it more powerful and user friendly.

  
### **Upgrades**

  
#### Introducing Scenario Recipes

  
* Weâ€™ve completely reimagined how you set up your If/Else conditions by introducing Scenario Recipes. These are pre-built templates that simplify the setup process:  
   * Select from one of our pre built recipes just for If/Else.  
   * Click the dropdown and select from the 10 recipe types we have or build your own.  
   * These recipes will also tell you if there are any pre requisites you want to add before using these recipes.

#### Enhanced Branch Functionality
* The If/Else branches in the builder have also gone through a major upgrade.  
   * You can now see a concise text summary of each branch, making it easier to understand at a glance which conditions are being met.  
   * For branches with multiple conditions, simply click "+x more conditions" to view a full list in a convenient pop-up window.  
   * Clicking on any branch will isolate it for editing while collapsing others, so you can focus on one branch at a time.

#### "Time of the Day" condition  
   * In the "Current Hour" condition type user was only able to select the hour options.  
   * We have added a new option in "Date - Time" condition and that is "Time of the Day"  
   * This allows users to select specific times down to 15-minute intervals, offering more granular control.  
   * For simplifying, we show descriptions of selected values to indicate in what situation those will be true
