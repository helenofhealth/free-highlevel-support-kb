## **Execution Logs - UI/UX Changes**

  
### **"View Details" Hyperlink**

  
Previously represented by an icon, the "View Details" option is now a more user-friendly hyperlink. This change makes it easier to identify and access execution details for any specific action.

### **Improved Error Visibility**

  
When any action encounters an error, the Status field or the View Details link will now be highlighted. This enhancement helps users quickly spot issues and take action without sifting through large amounts of data.

### **Highlighting Opened Rows**

  
When the Details section for a specific row item is opened, the row will be highlighted, providing a clear visual reference. This enhancement ensures that users can easily keep track of the current row they are analyzing.

### **Action Column Overhaul** 

  
* Previously, the "**Action**" column only displayed the action type, which could be confusing if multiple actions of the same type existed.
* We’ve replaced this with the "**Action** **Name**" that you assign.
* Hovering over the Action Name will display the actual **action** **type** for additional context.

### **Enhanced Sorting in Filters**

  
Within the filter dropdown, actions that are part of the workflow will appear first. In a separate section, other actions will be listed for clarity. This breakdown makes filtering by action types more intuitive and helps users prioritize actions directly linked to their workflows.

### **New Workflow Statuses**

  
The statuses displayed in the Enrollment History now provide better insights on why a contact exited or completed a workflow:  
  
* "**Workflow Completed**": When the contact completes the workflow naturally.
* "**Removed by Workflow Action**": When the contact is removed due to an action within the current workflow.
* "**Removed by External Workflow Action**": When the contact is removed because of an action in a different workflow.

### **Pagination**

  
Both the Enrollment History and Execution Logs tabs now support pagination. Users can choose how many row items are displayed per page, with options for **10, 25, or 50 rows at a time**. This improves performance and usability for large workflows.
