# **What Are Advanced Filters and Smart Lists?**

  
Advanced Filters and Smart Lists in workflows help streamline workflow management by allowing users to filter, organize, and save customized workflow views. Advanced Filters enable you to refine workflows based on triggers, actions, tags, or other criteria, making it easier to locate and manage them efficiently. Smart Lists take it a step further by allowing you to save filtered results for quick access, ensuring that you can revisit specific workflow sets without repeatedly applying filters. Together, these features simplify workflow organization and improve operational efficiency.

## **Key Benefits of Advanced Filters & Smart Lists in Workflows**

  
Managing workflows efficiently is essential for maintaining seamless automation. Advanced Filters and Smart Lists provide powerful tools to organize, locate, and track workflows effortlessly.

  
* **Streamlined Workflow Management:** Quickly find specific workflows by applying multiple filters based on triggers, actions, or tags, eliminating the need for manual searches.

  
* **Time-Saving & Improved Organization:** Save filtered views as Smart Lists for easy access, reducing repetitive filtering and keeping workflows well-structured, especially for growing businesses.

  
* **Better Collaboration & Visibility:** Agencies and teams can categorize workflows for different clients, ensuring smoother collaboration and enhanced tracking of automation processes.

  
* **Prevents Redundant Workflows & Support Queries:** Users can avoid unnecessary duplication of workflows and minimize support queries by leveraging filters and saved lists to quickly locate existing automation.

## **Advanced Filters vs. Smart Lists: Understanding the Difference**

  
When organizing workflows in HighLevel, you have two options: using Advanced Filters or creating a Smart List. While both features help you refine and sort your workflows, they serve different purposes depending on your needs.

  
### **Using Advanced Filters (One-Time Use)**

  
Advanced Filters allow you to apply conditions on the fly to find specific workflows without saving them. For example, if you want to quickly see all workflows that are in a paused state, you can apply a filter for Status = Paused, and the system will instantly display the relevant results. Once you’re done, you can exit without saving the filter.

  
This is ideal when you need to find something once or occasionally but don’t require frequent access to the filtered view.

  
### **Creating a Smart List (For Repeated Use)**

  
A Smart List, on the other hand, is a saved view of filtered results. Instead of manually applying filters every time, you can create a Smart List by clicking “+ Smart List”, adding filters, and saving the view. This saved list will always be available on your Workflows Dashboard, allowing quick access whenever needed.

  
For example, if you frequently monitor workflows triggered by form submissions, you can create a Smart List for all workflows where the trigger is Form Submitted, saving you time from reapplying the filter every time.

## **How to Use Advanced Filters**

  
### **Step 1: Accessing Workflows**

  
Navigate to the **Automations** tab in HighLevel and open the **Workflows** section. Here, you will see a list of all workflows created in your account.

### **Step 2: Opening Advanced Filters**

  
In the top-right corner of the Workflows page, locate and click on the **Advanced Filters** button. This will open a panel on the right side, allowing you to start filtering workflows based on specific conditions.

### **Step 3: Setting Your Filters**

  
Once the Advanced Filters panel is open, you’ll see a list of available filter options. You can filter workflows based on:

  
* **Triggers:** View workflows based on specific trigger events (e.g., “Form Submitted” or “Appointment Booked”).
* **Actions:** Filter workflows that include specific actions (e.g., “Send SMS” or “Add Tag”).
* **Tags:** Display only the workflows that have specific tags assigned to them.
* **Other Attributes:** Filter by workflow status (Published, Draft), last updated date, or the person who last modified the workflow.

### **Applying Filter Conditions**

  
**Select a Filter:** Choose a filter type from the dropdown menu.

  
**Choose the Operator:** Pick an operator (e.g., “equals,” “contains,” “does not contain”).

### **Step 4: Adding Multiple Filters**

  
To refine your search further, you can add multiple filters to customize how workflows are displayed based on different conditions.

  
**\+ And Condition:** Requires all selected filters to match for a workflow to appear in results. This is useful when you need to find workflows that meet multiple criteria at the same time. (Example: Workflows that are both Published AND use a Form Submission trigger.)

  
**Or Condition:** Displays workflows that match at least one of the selected filters. This expands your search to include either condition rather than requiring both to be true. (Example: Workflows that are either Published OR have a specific tag.)

**\+ Add Filter Condition:** Allows workflows to match any of the selected filters based on different attributes, giving you more flexibility when searching for specific workflows.

**Deleting a Filter:** Use Trash bin icon to delete the filter.

### **Step 5: Applying Filters**

  
After setting up the desired filters, click the Apply button to display workflows that match your criteria.

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

  
**Q. What is the difference between a filter and a Smart List?**

A filter temporarily narrows down workflows based on selected conditions, while a Smart List saves those filtered conditions for easy access in the future.
  
  
**Q. How many filters can I apply at once?**

There is no strict limit. You can apply multiple filters and use both And and Or conditions to refine results based on your requirements.
  
  
**Q. How do I edit or delete a Smart List?**

Click on Customize List, where you can update filter settings or remove the Smart List if no longer needed.
  
  
**Q. Who can view and manage Smart Lists?**

* If a user creates a Smart List, only that user and admins can see it.
* If an admin creates a Smart List, all admins can see it, but regular users cannot.
* If a user gets upgraded to an admin, they gain access to all Smart Lists created by other admins.
* If an admin gets downgraded to a user, they can only see the Smart Lists they personally created.
  
  
**Q. Can Advanced Filters be used on all workflow types?**

Yes! Advanced Filters work with all workflows, regardless of complexity or structure.
