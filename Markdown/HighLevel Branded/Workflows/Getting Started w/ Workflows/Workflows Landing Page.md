## Overview

New users of Workflows can now enjoy a **simplified, tailored onboarding experience** on the Workflow Automations landing page. The page has been redesigned with **visual guidance** and **curated content** based on the business niche you select during onboarding. This means from day one, you'll see examples and suggestions relevant to _your_ industry, making it easier to understand how automations work and to set up your first workflow quickly.

  
## What's New

## Tailored Onboarding by Business Niche

* When you first start with Workflows, you'll be asked to choose your business niche (industry). The platform then customizes your experience based on that choice. Everything from the examples to the suggested templates will align with your niche.

  
## Predefined Workflow "Recipes" for Top Niches:

* We’ve added ready-made workflow templates (called **Recipes**) for popular niches like **Education**, **Health**, **Finance**, and **Real Estate**. These recipe templates cover common automation scenarios in each industry. For example, a Real Estate agent might see a pre-built recipe for following up with new property inquiries, while a Health clinic might get a recipe for appointment reminders. You can use these niche-specific recipes as a starting point and customize them to fit your needs, instead of building from scratch.

  
## Smartlist Interactive Guided Workflow Builder

* The new landing page highlights how workflows function by visually illustrating a trigger-event leading to an action. At the top of the page, you'll see a simple diagram labeled **“If This Happens –> Do This”**. This shows a sample trigger (for example, _Customer booked appointment_) and a sample action (for example, _Send email_) connected by an arrow, so you can immediately grasp that **Triggers** (events that start a workflow) lead to **Actions** (tasks the workflow performs). This visual cue helps understand the basic building blocks of a workflow at a glance.
  
  
## New Layout with Recipe Cards and On-Page Videos

* A **Learn About Workflows** section with tutorial videos. You can scroll the landing page to find a recipe and launch it, or watch a quick intro video without navigating away. In short, everything you need – templates to start with and learning resources – is available at a glance on the landing page, making it much easier to get started.
