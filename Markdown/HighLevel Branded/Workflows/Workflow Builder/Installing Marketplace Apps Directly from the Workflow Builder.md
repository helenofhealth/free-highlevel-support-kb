## **Accessing the App Directory in Workflows**

  
Inside the Workflow Builder, you’ll see a “Discover” button located within the action panel. Clicking this opens a full list of available marketplace apps without ever leaving your workflow. This integrated view brings convenience and clarity to app discovery.

## **Browsing and Filtering Apps**

  
To help you find the right app quickly, the in-workflow app directory supports categorized browsing. You can explore apps by:

• Top Installed – Most frequently added by users.

• Top Free – Popular apps available at no cost.

• Top Paid – Best-selling premium integrations.

• Newly Added – Recently published or updated apps.

  
This categorization gives you a clear overview of what’s trending or newly available.

• Pricing (if applicable)

• Reviews and ratings

  
You’ll also see a prominent Install button that lets you add the app to your account instantly. After installation, the app’s actions and triggers will appear in your “All Actions” panel in the workflow builder, just like built-in steps.

## **Identifying App Updates**

  
If you’ve already installed an app and new actions have since been added by the developer, you’ll see an Update tag next to the app in the Discover panel. This helps you stay informed about new capabilities that you can start using right away without needing to reinstall the app.
