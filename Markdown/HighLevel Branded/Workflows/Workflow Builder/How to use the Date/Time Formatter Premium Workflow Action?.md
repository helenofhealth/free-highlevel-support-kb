## **Frequently Asked Questions**

  
**Q. How do I use the formatted date or time in other workflow actions?**

Once the Date/Time Formatter action processes a date or time, it stores the reformatted value in a dynamic variable (e.g., {{datetime\_formatter.1.date}}, {{datetime\_formatter.1.datetime}}). You can reference this variable in subsequent workflow actions, such as sending emails, updating CRM fields, or triggering conditional logic based on the date value.

  
**Q. What happens if I select the wrong format in the “From Format” field?**

If the selected From Format does not match the actual format of the input date, the workflow may fail to process the date correctly. This can result in missing or incorrect date values. Always ensure that the From Format accurately represents the original date structure before converting it.

  
**Q. Can I compare a date field from a contact’s record with the current date?**

Yes, the Compare Dates function allows you to compare a stored contact date (e.g., “Signup Date” or “Last Purchase Date”) with the Current Date. This can be useful for triggering reminders, follow-ups, or automated actions when a certain number of days have passed. The difference in days will be stored in {{datetime\_formatter.1.days}} for further use in workflows.

  
**Q. Can the Date/Time Formatter action handle time zone differences?**

The Date/Time Formatter action processes dates and times based on the system’s default time zone settings. If your workflow involves users across different time zones, ensure that you standardize all date/time values or convert them accordingly before applying formatting.
