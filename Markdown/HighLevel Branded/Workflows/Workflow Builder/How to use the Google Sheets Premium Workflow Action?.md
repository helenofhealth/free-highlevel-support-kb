# **What is the Google Sheets Premium Workflow Action?**

  
The Google Sheets Premium Workflow Action allows you to integrate Google Sheets directly into HighLevel workflows, automating data transfers between the two systems with no third-party integration. This action supports various functions which include creating, looking up, updating, and deleting rows in a connected Google Sheet.

  
In the Workflow Builder this is called an Action and in the Action settings the functions are also called Actions. We will refer to sub-Actions like Create Spreadsheet Row as functions.

---

## **Key Benefits of Google Sheets Integration**

  
* **Structured Data Management**: Ensures data is organized the same way every time.
* **Automation**: Reduces manual effort by syncing data instantly.
* **Error Reduction**: Prevents duplication or errors from manual data entry.
* **Scalability**: Supports growing datasets and increased operations tempo without any changes.

---

## **Before You Start**

  
Before setting up the Google Sheets action, ensure the following:

  
1. **A Google account is integrated** with the HighLevel subaccount.
2. **A Google Sheet is prepared.** Ensure the sheet is named and has clearly defined headers.
3. **Premium Triggers & Actions enabled** in your HighLevel Agency account and the Subaccount.

Some Triggers & Actions are premium, meaning HighLevel charges the Agency for every execution in every Subaccount ($0.01 per execution, far less than other platforms charge). Agencies on the Pro plan can Rebill the Subaccounts, automatically covering costs or profiting. The Workflow Pro plan is a separate subscription the Agency can Resell to Subaccounts which pre-purchases premium triggers & actions at a bulk rate.

#### **Create Spreadsheet row if it doesn't exist yet:**

#### If enabled, it will execute Create Spreadsheet Row action when the lookup could not find any matching row at the time of execution. This action will be logged and charged separately.  
![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/48294757968/original/gFVg7udmk8YIEO8JVUB319ME31a2YFXBHw.png?1682592032)

  
### **Lookup Multiple Spreadsheet Row(s)**

  
Lookup Multiple Spreadsheet Row(s) is an extension to the Lookup Spreadsheet Row. Using this we can extract multiple rows. The configuration will be the same as Look Spreadsheet Row just with an addition of selecting the number of rows you want to extract.

  
The only difference is selecting the number of rows and that can be achieved by typing in the number of Rows in the "Row Count" field.

  
![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155025719351/original/UBHwpCpCW0i-lmy6t4QBIWy-Wh3aDZXI_A.png?1715178858)
  
  
#### **Using as Custom Variables:**

One of the advantages of using Lookup is that when you search for a particular row, all of its data can be saved as a custom value that can be utilized throughout your workflow.

  
Consider the following Worksheet as an example. If you need to search for a specific row, you can enter the contact phone number or email address in the lookup section. Once the lookup function finds the matching row, it will store all the values under the corresponding header name as custom variables.

#### **![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/48294015115/original/LGaxBgQwvGYJoILbTF4nkBZzWgXDoySsyA.png?1682260855)**
  
  
When you add a Lookup action, an index is automatically generated. This index is essential for mapping the row data to the custom variables and allows for easy identification of multiple lookup values. Removing or editing the index once it is added is impossible.

  
![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/48294015133/original/XkZFM8oEj5xmLie9900hm1X7SmVVdhmidg.png?1682260890)

  
The values obtained from the lookup action for a particular row can be used in all other activities within your workflows, just like any other contact fields or custom variables.

  
![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/48294015142/original/GJblMYbDnexU3c5q-lBeQMQ812EGRVdK4A.png?1682260923)![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/48294015154/original/O4T0vx4kMtrqadNUUSZ1E3xXPUtgLbzlFw.png?1682260954)
  
  
**Please Note:**

As previously mentioned, the index generated by the lookup function serves as a reference and is used for internal mapping of the custom variables in lookup actions.
  
  
You can use {{sheet.x.rowNumber}} to get the row number of the lookup value.

  
Here x is the index of the lookup action.

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/48294015187/original/viPTWFRwhmb1scMyguQYVXDynZa8OxKdww.png?1682261023) 

**Example:**

The custom values of LookedUp Row can be utilized in all of the actions within your workflow. Some examples of how to do this are provided below.

  
![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/48294015228/original/e-kSxKyAnih4z5l92rupHPtUFgddgBdK1g.gif?1682261092)

  
**In If/Else:**

  
![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/48294015249/original/nNpO9JtVAJ9DWXrirZwplnuD9MpFPGai4Q.gif?1682261136)
  
  
#### **Important points to remember:**

* Referencing the Google Sheets Lookup Action cannot find a matching row; all subsequent Google Sheets Actions that reference this Lookup Action will be skipped due to lack of a result. Therefore, consider this when building workflows that include this Lookup Action and the Google Sheets: Update Spreadsheet Row using Lookup or Google Sheets: Delete Spreadsheet Row using Lookup.

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

  
**Q: Can I update or delete all rows returned by a Lookup Multiple Spreadsheet Row(s) action?**

The Lookup Multiple Spreadsheet Row(s) action is designed to retrieve and reference multiple rows at once. However, Google Sheets actions like **Update** and **Delete** are intended to work with **one row at a time**. These follow-up actions do not automatically loop through multiple results from a Lookup Multiple action.

  
If your workflow requires updating or deleting multiple rows, you can implement custom logic using code actions or external automation tools that handle batch processing. This approach gives you greater control over how each row is processed while maintaining the flexibility of your workflow.
