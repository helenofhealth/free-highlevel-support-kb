Our platform has been evolving rapidly and Workflows is a robust feature designed to enhance your automation experience. As a part of this evolution, we will be sunsetting the Campaigns feature.

  
**Why the change?** Workflows provide a more powerful and flexible automation solution, simplifying workflow management and maintenance.

  
**Timeline for Sunsetting Campaigns**

  
**Step 1 -** User will not be able to create new Campaigns and Triggers from 15th April 2024

**Step 2 -** No support will be available for Campaigns and Triggers from 15th April 2024
  
  
**What does this mean for you?**

* **Migration to Workflows:** We encourage you to migrate your existing Campaigns to Workflows for a seamless transition.

  
**Please Note:** Campaigns and Triggers Tab wont be shown in the CRM now. Please use Workflows for better functionality. Refer to [Workflow Builder Walkthrough](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/155000001254-workflow-builder-walkthrough)
