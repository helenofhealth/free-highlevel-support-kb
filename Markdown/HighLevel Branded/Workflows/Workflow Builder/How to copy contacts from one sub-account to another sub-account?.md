## **Prerequisites for Using 'Copy Contact'**

  
* Agencies must be on any High-Level plan ($97, $297, $497, or their annual equivalents).
* LC Premium Triggers & Actions must be enabled via Agency Settings.
* Existing and new sub-accounts will have 100 free executions once Premium Actions & Triggers are enabled.
* To avoid execution costs for existing sub-accounts, rebilling needs to be enabled manually for each sub-account within the Agency view.
* If premium actions are enabled on the SaaS Configurator, new sub-accounts generated will automatically be enrolled in LC Premium Actions & Triggers, requiring no further action by the agency.

4\. Optionally, enable the following settings:

  
* **Copy Tags**: To duplicate tags from the source contact. Organize your contacts effectively by adding multiple tags to newly copied contacts in your selected sub-account. You can choose tags from the source contact information or even create new ones manually.
* **Copy Custom Fields**: To duplicate custom fields, provided they exist in the target sub-account.
* **Update Contact if it Already Exists**: To update existing contacts in the target sub-account.
* **Skip Copy if Contact Lacks Email and Name**: To prevent copying incomplete contacrecords.
  
  
**Copy Custom Fields**

#### If enabled, contact custom fields will be copied to the selected account. The custom field value will be copied only if that field exists in the selected account.

  
#### **Toggle : Update contact if it already exists**

* If this is enabled and if the contact already exists in the selected sub-account then the contact will be updated in the sub account.
* If the contact is not existing in the sub account then new contact will be created.

#### Skip Copy Contact if Contact does not have Email and Name
