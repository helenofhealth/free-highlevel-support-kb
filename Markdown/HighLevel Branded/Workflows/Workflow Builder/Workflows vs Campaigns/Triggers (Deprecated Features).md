Campaigns and Triggers are deprecated. Workflows make it easy to create automation with triggers and actions with more capabilities. Workflows have capabilities like using if-else statements, wait times, math functions and so much more. Overall, workflows offer a more powerful and comprehensive automation solution. This article is provided for context.

## **Why Replace Campaigns and Triggers with Workflows?**

  
* Workflows can use [**if/else conditions**](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/48001180266-workflow-builder-if-else-conditional-event) and filtering, which allows for more personalized and targeted automation.
* They combine triggers and campaigns into one system, making it more efficient and streamlined.
* Workflows have a status/execution log that makes it easier to troubleshoot and track lead status.
* Workflows are easier to test during onboarding and launch for quality assurance, ensuring that the product is working correctly for clients.

You can [**import your campaigns into workflows**](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/48001196570-creating-campaigns-in-workflows), and then add the triggers as well for a more streamlined automation process.

## **Why are Campaigns and Triggers not visible in my Sub-account?**

  
To see Campaigns & Triggers the subaccount has to be created from a snapshot of an older subaccount that still has them. If the sub-account was created using a snapshot of a master account that did not already have campaigns and triggers in it then it will not allow you to see the depreciated features setting in **sub-account> Settings> Business Profile.**

  
But if it was created using the snapshot of a master sub-account that already had triggers and campaigns in it, it should give you the option to enable depreciated features in Business Profile settings.

The CRM is moving clients towards workflows and moving them away from campaigns and triggers, so these two features are automatically disabled and have no option to be enabled in sub-accounts that were created using snapshots of sub-accounts that did not have these features, to begin with.

  
Agencies created after November 2021 do not see the option to enable Deprecated Features Campaigns & Triggers.
