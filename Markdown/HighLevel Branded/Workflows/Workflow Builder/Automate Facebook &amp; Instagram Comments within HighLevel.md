# **What is Facebook & Instagram Automation?**

  
Facebook & Instagram (FBIG) have billions of active users, but they don't provide many tools for managing contacts, customers, and conversations efficiently at scale. You want to automate some amount of these activities, so the conversations happen in FBIG, but are managed from inside your CRM, and ideally can leverage the power of AI.

  
HighLevel can integrate with FBIG so you get the best of both systems. All you have to do is configure several different components correctly. This guide will explain each of those components, several patterns for making them work together, and where to leverage AI.

## **Before You Start**

Make sure that your Instagram is connected to your Facebook Business page. The simplest way is to navigate to your page and look for both icons.
