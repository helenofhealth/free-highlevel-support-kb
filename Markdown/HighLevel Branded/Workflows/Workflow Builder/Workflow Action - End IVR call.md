#### **What is End IVR call?**

  
End IVR call allows you to terminate the IVR call from your end. 

Presently, workflow owners lack the option to terminate calls from their end. This means that after IVR actions are done, the contact waits with elevator music until the subsequent non-IVR actions finish, and the call ends only at the workflow's conclusion. This leaves contact either listening to endless elevator music till the workflow reaches the end or hanging up themselves.
  
  
#### **How does End IVR call work?**

  
End IVR call action works as a new action in the workflows. Users can choose to end the call with a text message, custom voice message or abruptly.

3. Custom music - Users can choose to upload a voice message or branded music or any other audio format to be played before the IVR call is terminated along with the loops

  
#### **4\. What happens to the IVR actions after End IVR call actions?**
