There can be multiple scenarios when a customer is booking an appointment. This document outlines the scenarios, how the workflow will behave in each case and what will be the contact's journey.

### **Scenario 1 - Re-entry of a contact when appointment is booked**

  
A customer can book multiple appointments at once. For Appointment trigger, a contact can enter the workflow multiple times even if the contact is already present in the workflow.

A contact can book multiple appointments so the contact should be able to enter the workflow multiple times irrespective of Allow Re-entry or it being already present in the workflow.

  
For the remaining scenarios we will be using the below mentioned example

### **Scenario 2 - Appointment cancellation**

  
**Example:**

* **Current Date:** June 20
* **Appointment Date:** June 25
* **Workflow Step:** The contact is at the "Wait for 5 days" step.

  
**Change:** The customer cancels the appointment.

  
**When the appointment is treated as "Cancelled"** \- If the appointment status is changed from New/Confirmed/Show to Cancel/Invalid/No Show then the appointment is treated as "Cancelled"

  
**Result:** The customer will be pulled out of the workflow, and no further actions will occur.

  
**Why -** As the contact has cancelled the appointment no further actions should be performed.

### **Scenario 3 - Reschedule to a later date**

  
**Example:**

* **Current Date:** June 20
* **Original Appointment Date:** June 25
* **New Appointment Date:** June 30
* **Workflow Step:** The contact is at the "Wait for 5 days" step.

  
**Change:** The customer reschedules the appointment to June 30.

  
**When the appointment is treated as "Rescheduled"** \- When there are changes in the "Start time" and "End time" of an appointment then it is treated as "Rescheduled"

  
**Result:** The contact will be pulled out of the workflow. If the workflow has a trigger set to fire on _Appointment Status = Rescheduled_, and the rescheduled appointment matches all trigger filter conditions (e.g., correct calendar, assigned user), the contact will re-enter the workflow — _but only if the “Allow Re-entry” setting is enabled in the workflow’s settings._

  
**Why** \- When an appointment is rescheduled (i.e., start and/or end time changes), it updates the appointment status. If this updated status matches the criteria of a workflow trigger with “Allow Re-entry” enabled, the contact can re-enter and continue receiving communication relevant to the new appointment time. If the conditions aren't met, the contact will not re-enter the workflow.

### **Scenario 4 - Recurring appointments**

  
**Explanation:** Recurring appointments will not trigger entry through the "Customer Booked Appointment" trigger.
