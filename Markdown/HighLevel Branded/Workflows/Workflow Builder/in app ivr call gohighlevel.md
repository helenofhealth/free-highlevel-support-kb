#### **What is In app call for IVR?**

  
Previously, our IVR system only allowed calls to be routed to phone numbers. Now, we've added a feature that lets you route these IVR calls to either a staff member's mobile phone or their GHL app (both web and mobile versions).
  
  
#### **How to configure?**

  
* Go to Settings -> My staff
* Click on Edit and go to "Call & Voicemail Settings" section.
* Select from a set of options in the "Default channel for IVR"
* Web app - Receive IVR calls on GHL web app
* Mobile app
* My Phone number
