Workflow folder permissions is only available on the [Agency Pro Plan](https://help.gohighlevel.com/en/support/solutions/articles/48001180534) & above.

## **Restrict access to any folder containing workflows with Folder Permissions**

**Folders allow you to organize content and workflows allow you to automate tasks. You spend hours putting together battle-tested workflows, the last thing you want is unauthorized changes.**   
  
With folder permissions users without access, won't be able to see, create and edit any workflows within that folder. So, if the folder permissions are set to agency admin, then only users with the agency admin role can see, create and edit workflows.
