* Selecting Start column and End Column in the worksheet - When sending data to a Google Sheets document using our workflow system, the sheet's first row is automatically considered the header row, and each Column is labeled based on the header values in that row.
* If you need to update the headers in the sheet, you can click the "Refresh Headers" button to fetch the latest header values from the sheet. This ensures that your data is correctly mapped to the correct columns in the sheet and that your workflow is up-to-date with the latest sheet configurations.
* By providing this functionality, our system makes it easy to automate data management processes and ensure the accuracy of your data workflows.
