#### Overview:

Writing custom code in workflows just got smarter, faster, and easier—thanks to AI! We’re thrilled to introduce Code with AI (Beta), enabling users to generate custom code snippets with just a simple description.

#### Previous Behaviour:

* Previously, creating custom code within workflows required users to write JavaScript code from scratch, which could be time-consuming and required programming expertise.
* Manually map input properties from previous workflow steps to use within the code.
* Test and debug code manually before implementation.
* This process demanded a significant investment of time and technical skill.

#### What’s New?

* Now we have AI-Assisted Code Generation. With Code with AI, the process is streamlined:
* AI-Powered Code Generation – Describe the desired functionality in plain language, and AI will generate JavaScript code for you.
* Automated Property Integration – AI intelligently incorporates relevant input properties based on your description.
* One-Click Implementation – Quickly review and insert AI-generated code into your workflow.
* Regenerate if Needed – Not happy with the first result? Click Generate again for a fresh version.

Pro Tip: 

Be as specific as possible in your prompt for the best results!

#### How to Use It?

* Select: Choose Custom Code action in your workflow.

#### Use Cases

* Data Formatting – Automatically format phone numbers or dates to match your preferred style.
* API Integration – Generate code to connect with external services via HTTP requests.
* Mathematical Calculations – Compute interest rates, discount percentages, or other formulas dynamically.
* String Manipulation – Extract key details from text, such as email addresses from subject lines.
* Conditional Logic – Implement custom decision-making processes, like routing leads based on specific criteria.
