## What is If Else?

  
If/Else lets you build advanced workflows to perform different actions based on different conditions. If/Else uses conditional logic: if A happens in your trigger app, then do X. If B happens, then do Y, and so on.
  
  
## **New Features**

  
1\. Duplicate branch

* Save time and effort by effortlessly copying existing branches. No need to rebuild from scratch. Click the three dots menu on a branch and choose "Duplicate Branch."
* The copied branch will appear below the original with "(copy)" added to its name. You can rename it as needed.

3\. Rename None branch
