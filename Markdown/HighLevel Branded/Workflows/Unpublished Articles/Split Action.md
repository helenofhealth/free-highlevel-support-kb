#### **3.1 Random Split**

  
****Purpose: Divide your contacts into multiple paths based on a random distribution according to the selected percentage, allowing you to test different variations of your workflow and identify the best performing one.**
  
  
**Features:**

* **Random Split:** Send contacts to different paths with percentages you define (e.g., 60% to Path A, 40% to Path B).
* **Multiple Paths:** Create up to 5 separate paths for your contacts to follow.
* **Customizable Path Names:** Rename each path to clearly identify its purpose.
* **Stats Tracking:** View detailed statistics on the number of contacts entering and completing each path, as well as their goal conversions.

  
**Getting Started:**

1. **Add the Split action** to your workflow by clicking on the "+" icon to add an action and selecting "Split" from the "Internal Tools" category.

**Example for Random Split**

  
The distribution in random split is totally random just like rolling a dice is random. 

**Imagine you have 100 customers entering a workflow.** You've set up a Random Split with two paths: **Path A** and **Path B**, each with a **50% chance** of receiving a customer. This split is like flipping a coin: each path has an equal chance of being chosen for each customer.

**Here's how the distribution might look:**

* **Customer 1:** Flips heads, goes to **Path A**.
* **Customer 2:** Flips tails, goes to **Path A** (again).
* **Customer 3:** Flips heads, goes to **Path B**.
* **Customer 4:** Flips tails, goes to **Path B** (again).
* **Customer 5:** Flips tails, goes to Path B (again).
* **Customer 6:** Flips tails, goes to Path A.

This pattern continues randomly, with each customer having a chance of going to either path, **regardless of previous choices**.
  
  
#### 4\. Use Cases

  
**Scenario:** You're an e-commerce store owner selling new running shoes. You have two email subject lines in mind: "Fuel Your Run with the Ultimate Shoe" and "Unleash Your Speed: Our Game-Changing Shoes."

**Solution:** Use the Random Split action to divide your mailing list randomly (e.g., 75/25). Send 75% of the list the "Fuel Your Run" email and the other 25% to the "Unleash Your Speed" email. Track website visits, purchase rates, and other key metrics for each path.

**Outcome:** After a set period, analyze the results and see which subject line led to higher engagement and sales. Now, you have data-driven proof of the best performing message, which you can confidently apply to future campaigns.
  
  
#### 5\. Points to be noted
  
  
* Once a contact heads down one path, that is their only path. If they re-enter they will not proceed down the other path they will always head down the original path.
