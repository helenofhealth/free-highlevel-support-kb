## **Frequently Asked Questions**
  
  
**Q: What happens if access is granted again to a contact who already has it?**

If a contact is granted access to the same course offer more than once, HighLevel won’t duplicate the enrollment or reset their progress. The contact will retain their existing access without any disruption. However, any follow-up actions in the workflow—like sending an email—will still run unless conditions are added to prevent that.

  
**Q: Can I grant access to a course without a payment gateway?**

Yes, you can grant access to a course without requiring payment by creating an offer with no paywall under **Memberships > Offers**. This is useful for free training, onboarding, or internal educational content.

  
**Q: Do I need to create the offer before using the Course Grant Offer action?**

Yes, the offer must be created in advance under **Memberships > Offers**. The Course Grant Offer action references existing offers—you cannot create a new offer directly from the workflow.

  
**Q: Will contacts receive login details automatically after access is granted?**

Not automatically. If you want contacts to receive login instructions or course access links, you’ll need to add an email step in the workflow after the Course Grant Offer action using a prebuilt email template.
