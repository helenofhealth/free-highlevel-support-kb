## Example

**Scenario**: You want to track when visitors reach the “Checkout” page of your funnel and then send them a follow-up email if they abandon their cart.

* **Trigger**: Funnel/Website PageView
* **Funnel/Website**: Funnel Name (e.g., Bookkeeper Funnel)
* **Page**: Is equal to “Checkout”
* **Action**: Send a follow-up email offering assistance after a specific amount of time if no purchase is completed.

This setup allows you to re-engage customers who might have dropped off at the final stage of purchasing.
