### **Step 3: Naming the Trigger**

  
Give your trigger a clear and descriptive name that reflects its purpose. A well-named trigger makes it easier to identify workflows, especially when managing multiple automations within the system.

### **Step 4: Applying Filters**

####   

Filters help fine-tune your workflow so it only triggers when specific changes happen to an opportunity.

  
#### **Assigned To Filter**

  
The Assigned To filter triggers the workflow when an opportunity is reassigned to a different team member. This is particularly useful for sales and support teams that manage leads collaboratively. By using this filter, businesses can automate follow-up actions when ownership of an opportunity changes, ensuring a smooth handoff between team members.

  
For example, if a high-value lead is reassigned to a senior sales representative, the workflow can automatically notify the new owner, update internal records, or trigger a follow-up sequence. This helps maintain accountability and ensures that opportunities are not overlooked during the transition.

#### **Has Tag Filter**

  
The Has Tag filter allows you to trigger a workflow based on tags assigned to an opportunity. This filter ensures that automation is only activated when an opportunity contains a specific tag, providing more control over workflow execution.

  
For example, if a tag like “Hot Lead” or “Follow-Up Needed” is applied to an opportunity, the workflow can be configured to send automated follow-up emails, notify sales reps, or move the lead to a different pipeline stage. This is especially useful for segmenting leads, prioritizing high-value opportunities, and triggering specific actions based on lead categorization.

#### **In Pipeline Filter**

  
The In Pipeline filter triggers the workflow when an opportunity undergoes a change within a specific pipeline. This ensures that automation is only activated for opportunities that belong to the selected pipeline, allowing for more targeted workflow execution.

  
For instance, if a lead moves within the Sales Pipeline, but not the Customer Support Pipeline, the workflow can be configured to trigger only for the sales-related changes. This is particularly useful for businesses with multiple pipelines handling different processes, such as sales, onboarding, and client retention. By applying this filter, teams can ensure that workflows are executed within the appropriate context, reducing unnecessary automation triggers and improving workflow efficiency.

#### **Lead Value Filter**

  
The Lead Value Change filter triggers a workflow when the monetary value of an opportunity increases or decreases. This allows businesses to automate actions based on changes in potential revenue, ensuring that important updates do not go unnoticed.

  
For example, if a lead’s value is increased—perhaps due to an upsell or a revised quote—the workflow can notify the sales team, adjust pipeline stages, or send a custom follow-up email. Conversely, if the lead value decreases, the system can alert the account manager for review or trigger retention strategies to prevent loss.

#### **Lost Reason Filter**

  
The Lost Reason filter allows businesses to automate workflows when an opportunity is marked as Lost and a reason is assigned. This filter helps track and respond to lost deals strategically, enabling businesses to improve their sales approach and customer retention efforts.

  
To refine how this filter works, users can choose between the following filter operators:

  
**Has Changed:** Triggers the workflow whenever the lost reason is updated, regardless of the previous value. This is useful for tracking any modifications made to the reason assigned for a lost deal.

  
**Has Changed To:** Triggers the workflow only when the lost reason is updated to a specific value. For example, if the lost reason is changed to “Price Too High”, the system can send an automated follow-up email with a discount offer.

#### **Status Filter**

  
The Status filter allows workflows to trigger based on the current status of an opportunity. This ensures that actions are executed when an opportunity reaches a specific stage in the pipeline, helping teams track and manage their sales progress more efficiently.

  
The available filter operators for refining this filter include:

  
**Is:** Triggers the workflow when an opportunity matches the selected status. For example, if “Won” is selected, the workflow will activate only when an opportunity is marked as Won.

  
**Is Not:** Triggers the workflow when an opportunity does not match the selected status. This can be useful when filtering out certain statuses from triggering workflows, such as ignoring “Abandoned” opportunities.

  
After selecting an operator, users can choose from the available status options in the dropdown.

### **Step 4: Set Up Workflow Actions**

  
Once the trigger is set up, define the actions such as:

1. **Send Email or SMS Notification:** Notify sales reps about opportunity updates.
2. **Assign a Task:** Automatically create a follow-up task in the CRM.
3. **Update Contact Record:** Modify customer details based on opportunity changes.
4. **Trigger Another Workflow:** Link this trigger with other workflows for advanced automation.

  
### **Step 5: Save, Test, and Publish**

1. Click Save Trigger to finalize settings.
2. Run a test to ensure the workflow functions correctly.
3. Once verified, click Publish to activate the automation.

Yes! You can combine multiple filters, such as tracking only high-value leads that are reassigned to a senior sales rep.
  
  
**Q: How do I test if my workflow is working correctly?**

After setting up the trigger, manually update an opportunity and check if the workflow executes the expected actions. Review workflow logs to troubleshoot any issues.
  
  
**Q: Does this trigger work with opportunity custom fields?**

Yes! You can configure the trigger to activate when specific custom fields are updated within an opportunity record.
