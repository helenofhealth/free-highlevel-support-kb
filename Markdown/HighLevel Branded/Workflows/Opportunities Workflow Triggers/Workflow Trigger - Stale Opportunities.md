# **What is the Stale Opportunities Trigger?**

The **“Stale Opportunities”** trigger is a workflow action that activates when an opportunity has been in the same stage for a set period without any progress or updates. It enables you to take proactive measures to re-engage stagnant opportunities, ensuring no potential lead is overlooked. For example, if an opportunity remains in the **“Negotiation”** stage for 5 days without any updates, this trigger can automatically send a follow-up email, notify a manager, or reassign the opportunity to a new team member.

## **FAQs**

  
**Q: How do I determine the right “Duration in Days” to set for a stale opportunity?**

It depends on your sales cycle. For shorter cycles, 2-3 days may be sufficient, while longer cycles might require 7-10 days to consider an opportunity stale.

  
**Q: Can I apply the “Stale Opportunities” trigger to specific stages within a pipeline?**

Yes, you can specify a particular pipeline stage in the filter criteria so that the trigger only applies to opportunities in that stage.

  
**Q: How can I avoid false positives where opportunities appear stale but are actually being worked on?**

Use custom filters and conditions to exclude opportunities with recent updates or activities, such as notes, email replies, or logged calls, from being marked as stale.

  
**Q: Can I trigger the “Stale Opportunities” workflow to re-run if the same opportunity becomes stale again?**

Yes, as long as the opportunity moves to a new stage or is updated, the trigger will reset. If it becomes stale again according to your criteria, the workflow will run as expected.
