## **Frequently Asked Questions**

  
**Can I use multiple filters for the same trigger?**

  
Yes, you can combine filters like **“Has Tag”** and **“In Pipeline”** to create precise workflows that activate only under specific conditions.

  
**What happens if the opportunity status changes multiple times in quick succession?**

  
The trigger activates each time the status changes, so it’s essential to use conditions or cooldown periods in workflows to avoid redundant actions.

  
**Can I trigger actions across multiple pipelines?**

  
Yes, you can set up separate workflows for different pipelines or use filters to apply the trigger to specific pipelines as needed.

  
**How do I handle opportunities with no tags?**

  
Use the **“Doesn’t Have Tag”** filter to target opportunities without specific tags, ensuring workflows activate only for untagged opportunities.

  
**Is it possible to track why an opportunity was lost?**

  
Yes, use the **“Lost Reason”** filter to identify why an opportunity was lost and trigger workflows to address those reasons, such as sending feedback surveys or updating lead profiles.
