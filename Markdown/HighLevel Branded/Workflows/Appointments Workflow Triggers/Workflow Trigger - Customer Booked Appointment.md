## **Frequently Asked Questions** 

  
**Q. Can this trigger be used for recurring appointments?**

No, the Customer Booked Appointment trigger only works for normal (one-time) appointments. Recurring appointments are not supported.  
  
  
**Q. How can I trigger different workflows for different types of appointments?**

You can use filters such as **“In Calendar”** or **“In Calendar Group”** to target specific appointment types and set up separate workflows for each.  
  
  
**Q. What happens if a team member manually books the appointment on behalf of the customer?**

This trigger only activates when the customer independently books an appointment through a booking link. Manually booked appointments will not trigger the workflow.  
  
  
**Q. Can I send reminders at multiple intervals, like 48 hours and 24 hours before the appointment?**

Yes, you can add multiple reminder actions within the same workflow and set different wait times for each (e.g., wait for 48 hours, then send the first reminder; wait for another 24 hours, then send the second reminder).  
  
  
**Q. How can I track appointments booked by high-priority clients?**

You can use the **“Has Tag”** filter to create a workflow that triggers only when clients with a specific tag (e.g., “VIP Client”) book an appointment. This way, you can ensure timely follow-ups and special handling for important clients.
