## Overview

The **Find Opportunity** action allows you to locate an existing opportunity **linked to the contact** that triggered the workflow, based on specific criteria. You can choose to find either the **Earliest** (first created) or the **Latest** (most recently created) matching opportunity for that contact. Once found, this opportunity record becomes the reference for all subsequent opportunity-based actions in your workflow. If no match is found, the workflow branches to an alternate path, enabling you to handle that scenario differently (e.g., create a new opportunity).

> **Important:** If there is no contact in the workflow (for example, in the case of an inbound webhook that does not include contact information), you must configure the **Find Opportunity** filters to map certain fields to the webhook parameters. Otherwise, the action will not be able to locate an opportunity.

  
## Action Name

Find Opportunity

  
## Action Description

The **Find Opportunity** action searches for an existing opportunity linked to the contact who entered the workflow, matching the filters you specify. All filters are combined using **AND** logic, meaning **all** specified conditions must be met to return a match. If multiple opportunities satisfy these conditions, only one will be returned—either the earliest or the latest, as configured. If no match is found, the workflow continues along a separate “Opportunity Not Found” branch.

| **Action Name**             | A custom label to help you identify this step in your workflow.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | Yes           |
| **Opportunity to be Found** | Determines whether to retrieve the **Earliest** (first created) or **Latest** (most recently created) opportunity that meets the filter criteria for the contact entering the workflow.                                                                                                                                                                                      | Yes           |
| **Filters**                 | One or more conditions to narrow down the search. <ul><li>All filters use **AND** logic.</li><li>No limit to the number of filters.</li><li>Filters can reference any standard or custom opportunity field (e.g., Opportunity Name, Followers, Status).</li><li>If there is no contact (e.g., inbound webhook), filters must map certain fields to webhook params.</li></ul> | Yes           |
| **Multiple Matches**        | If multiple records match, **only one** opportunity is returned—either the earliest or latest, depending on your choice.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | —             |
| **Branching Behavior**      | If an opportunity is found, the workflow follows the **Opportunity Found** path. If no match is found, it follows the **Opportunity Not Found** path.                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | —             |

## Example

**Scenario**: A new lead submits a form, and you want to check if an existing opportunity already exists for that lead. If it does, you update the opportunity; if not, you create a new one.

1. **Trigger**: A contact submits a form on your website.
2. **Action**: _Find Opportunity_  
   * **Action Name**: “Locate Existing Opportunity”  
   * **Opportunity to be Found**: **Latest Opportunity**  
   * **Filters**(all conditions must be met):  
         * **Opportunity Name** → **Contains** → “Contact\_Email\_Address”  
         * **Status** → **Is** → “Open”
3. **Branching**:  
   * **Opportunity Found**: Proceed with an _Update Opportunity_ action to modify fields such as Status or add notes.  
   * **Opportunity Not Found**: Proceed with a _Create Opportunity_ action to add a new record to your pipeline.

This ensures you’re always referencing the correct existing opportunity if one is available, and only creating a new one when necessary.  
  
If no contact is present (e.g., from an inbound webhook without contact info), ensure your filters map relevant fields to the webhook data.
