# **What is Remove Opportunity** **Action** **in Workflows?**

  
The **"Remove Opportunity"** action allows you to delete an opportunity associated with a contact. This action helps keep your pipeline clean by removing opportunities that are no longer relevant. With the latest enhancements, you now have more flexibility in selecting which opportunity to remove:  
  
* **All contact opportunities in the selected pipeline.**
* **Opportunity found or triggered in this workflow.**

This allows for more precise control over opportunity management in your sales workflows.
