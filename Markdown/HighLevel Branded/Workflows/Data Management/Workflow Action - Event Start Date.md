## Example

* **Type: Specific Date/Time**  
   * Use Case: If you want to trigger a follow-up email one week after an event that was scheduled on a particular date.  
   * Example Setup: Select the date `September 14, 2024` to mark the event start. The workflow will use this as the reference point for all subsequent timed actions.
* **Type: Custom Field**  
   * Use Case: You want to set a follow-up action based on a custom date field like "Event Registration Date".  
   * Example Setup: The workflow pulls the date from the custom field `Event Registration Date` to trigger subsequent actions like reminder emails or task assignments based on that date.
* **Type: Specific Day**  
   * Use Case: For recurring events or tasks, you want to automate actions based on the current day of the week or month.  
   * Example Setup: Select "Current Day of Month" to set recurring reminders every first of the month.

  
## Additional Notes

* **Date Format**: Ensure the date and time are in the correct format (e.g., MM-DD-YYYY HH). This prevents errors in workflow timing.
* **Use Cases**: Perfect for automating reminders, follow-ups, or any action that is contingent on a specific date.
* **Triggering**: Combine this action with **Wait** events to hold contacts until a specific date or time before proceeding to the next action.
