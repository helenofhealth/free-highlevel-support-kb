# **What is the Copy and Delete Trigger Feature?**

  
Duplicating or removing triggers is now faster and easier than ever. Previously, users had to manually recreate similar triggers or click into each one just to delete them. With these new quality-of-life improvements, you can now instantly duplicate any trigger with all its logic intact—or remove one directly from the canvas using a simple dropdown menu.

##   

## **Key Benefits of the Copy and Delete Trigger Update**

  
Get more done with less effort by reusing and managing triggers in a smarter way.

* **Automatic naming** — Duplicates are labeled “Copy of \[Trigger Name\]” so you instantly know the origin
* **Quick edits** — Easily tweak filter conditions on copied triggers
* **One-click delete** — No need to open the trigger to remove it
* **Cleaner workflow canvas** — Easily manage and refine your automation logic
* **Fewer manual errors** — Reduce mistakes by duplicating proven trigger setups

2. Click **“Delete”**
