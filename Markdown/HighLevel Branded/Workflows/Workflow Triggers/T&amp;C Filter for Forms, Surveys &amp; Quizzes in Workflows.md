## Overview

We’ve introduced a new feature in workflows—T&C Filter, allowing accounts to filter users based on whether they agreed to the Terms and Conditions (T&C) or not. This enhancement helps streamline user targeting and ensures workflow steps are aligned with compliance requirements.

---

## Feature Benefits

* Improved User Segmentation: Filter users based on their T&C agreement status.
* Enhanced Compliance: Ensure only users who have agreed to specific terms and conditions proceed in workflows.
* Customizable Workflow Paths: Create targeted user journeys by setting conditions for users who agreed or did not agree to the T&C.
