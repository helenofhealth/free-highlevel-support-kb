## **How to create a Task Event in Campaigns**

  
Task events let you assign internal action items to your team at key moments in a contact's journey. These tasks act as reminders or manual to-dos that need to be completed when a contact reaches a specific step in a campaign.

Use task events to streamline internal operations — like reminding a team member to follow up with a lead, make a phone call, or review an account. You can customize the task name, due date, priority, notes, and assignee directly within the campaign step.

## **How to set up a Task Reminder Trigger**

  
Task triggers allow you to start automations based on actions taken on tasks — such as completion, assignment, or status changes. This is useful when you want follow-up actions to occur automatically in response to how your team handles tasks.
