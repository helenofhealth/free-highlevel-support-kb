## Overview

* **Set the Workflow Trigger Name:**  
   * Enter a descriptive name, such as "Task Completed Follow-up."
* **Apply Filters (Optional):**  
   * You can add filters to limit when the trigger fires. For example, you can specify that only tasks completed by a specific user should activate the trigger or tasks that contain specific values in custom fields.

## Example

Letâ€™s say you want to set up a workflow where a follow-up email is automatically sent to a contact after a sales task is marked as complete by a specific user.

* **Trigger Name:** Sales Task Completed
* **Assigned User:** John Doe
* **Filter:** Business Niche = Real Estate

Once John Doe completes a task assigned to a contact in the Real Estate niche, this trigger will fire and automatically move the workflow to the next step, such as sending an email to the contact or updating the CRM status.
