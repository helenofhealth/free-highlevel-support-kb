### **What is the Contact Tag Workflow Trigger?**

The Contact Tag Workflow Trigger allows you to automate workflows in HighLevel whenever a contact tag is added or removed. Tags are labels you assign to contacts to help you organize, categorize, and take action based on their attributes or behavior.

  
For example, adding a "New Customer" tag can trigger an automated welcome email, while removing a "Lead" tag can update sales team notifications.
