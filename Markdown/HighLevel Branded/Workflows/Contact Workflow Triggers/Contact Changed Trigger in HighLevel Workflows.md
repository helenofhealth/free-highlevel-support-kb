# **What Is the “Contact Changed” Workflow Trigger?**

  
The “Contact Changed” Workflow Trigger activates whenever a contact’s details are updated. For example: Tags Changed: If a tag like “Interested Customer” is added, the workflow can send a follow-up email. DND Status Changed: If a contact turns on “Do Not Disturb,” the workflow can stop sending messages. Assigned User Changed: If a contact is assigned to a new sales rep, the workflow can notify them. Custom Fields Updated: If a field like “Preferred Service” is updated, the workflow can send targeted offers. This trigger helps your business respond quickly and keeps everything organized by automating repetitive tasks.

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

  
**Q. What types of contact changes can trigger the “Contact Changed” workflow?**

The “Contact Changed” trigger can activate based on various contact updates, including:

* Tags Added or Removed – Example: If a contact is tagged as “Hot Lead”, trigger a sales follow-up.
* Contact Type Changed – Example: If a contact goes from a "Lead" to a "Customer"
* Custom Field Updates – Example: If a contact’s “Preferred Service” is updated, send targeted promotions.
* Assigned User Change – Example: If a contact is reassigned to a new sales rep, notify the rep immediately.
* DND Status Change – Example: If a contact enables “Do Not Disturb”, stop all outgoing messages.

  
**Q. Can I track multiple contact changes within a single workflow?**

Yes! You can add multiple filters under the “Contact Changed” trigger to track different types of changes simultaneously. For example, you can configure the workflow to trigger when either a tag is added OR a custom field is updated, ensuring the automation responds to multiple events.

  
**Q. What happens if a contact’s details change multiple times? Will the workflow trigger each time?**

Yes, the workflow will trigger each time a tracked change occurs. However, to prevent unnecessary actions (e.g., multiple emails being sent), you can:

* Use workflow conditions to check whether the action has already been performed.
* Apply filters to trigger only on specific changes.
* Add time delays to avoid excessive automation.

  
**Q. Can I trigger actions based on a deleted tag or an old value being removed?**

No, the “Contact Changed” trigger detects new updates but does not track removed values. If you need to automate actions based on a tag being removed, consider:

* Using an “If/Else” condition to check whether a contact still has a specific tag.
* Manually monitoring tag removals and triggering a different workflow accordingly.
