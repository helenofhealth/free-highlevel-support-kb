## Example

  
In this example, the workflow is set up to trigger when an existing note is changed for a contact who has a specific tag:

1. **Workflow Trigger Name:** `Note Changed`
2. **Filters:**  
   * **Has Tag:** `Important Client`

####   

#### **Example Workflow**

  
When a note is changed on a contact record, the following actions could be triggered:

* **Notify Account Manager:** Send an internal notification to the assigned account manager to review the changes made to the note on an important client's profile.
* **Update Task:** Automatically update or create a task for the team member to take appropriate follow-up action based on the modified note content.
* **Log Change:** Record the note change in a specific log or update the CRM to ensure there is a history of the modification.

This configuration ensures that the workflow is activated whenever a note is changed, allowing for immediate action and communication based on the updates to the note.
