## Overview

The **Task Added** trigger allows you to initiate a workflow whenever a new task is added to a contact's record. This is useful for automating actions based on task creation, such as notifying the assigned user, updating task-related fields, or sending follow-up messages.

  
## Trigger Name

**Task Added**

  
## Trigger Description

This trigger is activated when a new task is added to a contact's record. You can use filters to specify which tasks should start the workflow, such as tasks assigned to a particular user or tasks containing specific keywords.

  
## How to Configure

* **Choose a Workflow Trigger**: Select **Task Added** from the list of available triggers.
* **Workflow Trigger Name**: Enter a descriptive name for your trigger, such as "Task Added."
* **Filters**: Use filters to refine when the trigger should activate. This allows you to specify which tasks should start the workflow based on the assigned user.
