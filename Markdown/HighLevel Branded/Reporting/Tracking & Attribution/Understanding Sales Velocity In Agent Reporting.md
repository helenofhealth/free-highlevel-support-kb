## Sales velocity is the measurement of how quickly Opportunities become "Won" and generate revenue.

`Sales velocity` \= `Total Sales (in USD) / Average Sales Cycle (in month) ` 

  
Where,

  
Total Sales Value \= total sum of value of won opportunities (in the selected time range)  
Average Sales Cycle \= Total Sales Duration / Length of opportunities won  
Total Sales Duration \= Sum of the sales duration of all (won) opportunities

Length of opportunities won \=  
Individual sales duration \= Difference between the time creation of opportunity & time when opportunity is marked won

  
In other words,

  
Sales Velocity \= Monthly Sales Value, (V \* L) = Total Sales Value / Normalised Average Sales Cycle (in months)

  
For Example:

  
Let's say a User had 3 Opportunities were marked WON in the time period of 1 week.

* Opportunity #1 was created on Dec. 1st and was marked WON on Dec. 20th (open for 20 Days) and had a sales value of $30
* Opportunity #2 was created on Dec. 15th and was marked WON on Dec. 21st (open for 5 Days) and had a sales value of $50
* Opportunity #3 was created on Dec. 21st and was marked WON on Dec. 22nd (Open for 2 Day) and had a sales value of $70

In this case, 

  
Total Sales Value \= $150

Total Sales Duration \= (20 days from Opportunity #1 + 5 days from Op #2 + 2 days from Op #3) = 27 d

Average Sales Cycle \= 27 days / 3 won opportunities = 9 days

Average Daily Sales Value \= $150 / 9 days = $16.67 / day

Monthly Sales Value \= ($150 / 9 days) \* 30 days = $500/month

Sales Velocity \= $500/month
