## **Impressions**

An impression is the number of times your ad is displayed on a search results page or another website within the Facebook network.
  
  
## **Clicks**

A conversion is any user interaction that results in a predefined, valuable action for your business — whether it occurs on a website, landing page, social media platform (like Facebook), app, or other digital touchpoint.

  
Examples include signing up for a newsletter, completing a purchase, submitting a form, downloading a resource, or even engaging with a Facebook Lead Ad. You define what counts as a conversion based on your business goals. The ultimate aim of tracking conversions is to turn prospects into leads or customers.

**Conversion Rate**

Conversion rates are calculated by simply taking the number of conversions and dividing that by the number of total ad interactions that can be tracked to a conversion during the same time period. For example, if you had 50 conversions from 1,000 interactions, your conversion rate would be 5%, since 50 ÷ 1,000 = 5%
  
  
**Revenue** 

When an opportunity is marked as won, the opportunity will have a Lead value (monetary) added. It is sum total of all the opportunity which is marked as won for a specific Facebook ad campaign.
  
  
**Please note:**

When adding a lead value **only** use numerical integers. There is no need to add a $ sign as its already accounted for in the field (See example below)
