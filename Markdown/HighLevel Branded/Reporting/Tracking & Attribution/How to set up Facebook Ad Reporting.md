# **How to label your campaigns within Facebook to ensure accurate reporting**

  
**Please Note:**

Campaign name, Ads and Ad-set's need to be unique.(see "CORRECT SETUP Example" below)  
  
The name parameters can’t be changed during the lifetime of the campaign / Ad-set / Ad. If the name has to be changed, then create a different campaign / Ad-set / Ad.  
  
If you decided to change the campaign / Ad-set / Ad and do NOT create a new campaign, then data in the CRM system will keep referring to the original/ first campaign.
  
  
**CORRECT SETUP Example:**

Campaign Name: 

Campaign - Happy Teeth

  
Ad-set: 

Campaign#1 - Happy Teeth - Audience #1 (San Rafael, Ca 20 mile radius - M&F)

  
Ads: (Unique)

* Ad#1: Happy teeth - Carousel Ad - Audience #1
* Ad#2: Happy teeth - Video Ad - Audience #1
* Ad#3: Happy teeth - Image Ad - Audience #1
