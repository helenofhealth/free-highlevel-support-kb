**Plan-Based Access to Custom Reports**
The availability of custom reports depends on your current plan:

**$97 Plan** – Custom reports are not included.
**$297 Plan** – Access to 1 report with up to 5 elements and 15 widgets.
**$497+ Plan** – Full access with unlimited reports, elements, and widgets.


**When using the custom report builder, keep in mind how timezones affect the data:**

**Report Builder Date Range:** The data shown in the builder uses the **timezone set in your browser**.
**Email Preview:** The scheduled email preview uses the **sub-account's timezone.**
**Google and Facebook Ads Data:** For third-party integrations like Google Ads and Facebook Ads, the data is based on the **timezone configured in those ad accounts**, not the sub-account timezone.
