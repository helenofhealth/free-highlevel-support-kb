# **What is the AI Agent Marketplace for Conversation AI and Voice AI ?**

  
The AI Agent Marketplace is a built-in feature in HighLevel that allows you to publish, browse, and install prebuilt AI agent templates designed for chat and voice automation. These templates are built for use with **Conversation AI** (for messaging channels) and **Voice AI** (for phone calls), and come fully packaged with workflows, calendars, custom fields, and other assets required for smooth execution. Agency owners and admins can create and list agents for others to use, while sub-accounts can install only those that are approved for them. Whether you’re aiming to automate lead qualification, appointment booking, or customer engagement, the Marketplace provides a scalable, ready-to-use solution—eliminating the need to start from scratch.
