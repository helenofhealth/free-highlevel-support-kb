## **How is the experience for your client?**

* Your customers can discover the App marketplace in the left menu bar. To find more details, [click here](https://help.leadconnectorhq.com/en/support/solutions/articles/155000001158-marketplace-apps-view-installation)
* Click on an app and click on install.
* While installing, your customers will view the prices set by you. They can select a plan, make the payment and install the app.![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155010515077/original/SYmjd4CJgktxoicpFq7c3qdtDJt0N7PmMA.png?1697702906)
* Note: Your customers need to have card details added to their account to complete the payment & installation. If not, they can visit the company billing page (under sub-account settings), add their card details, come back to the app page and try installing again.

  
# **How does the billing work?**

When your client installs a paid app it creates 2 subscriptions in the System

  
* Between your client's card & your Stripe Account so you can collect payment from your clients.
* Between HighLevel & your Stripe account.
