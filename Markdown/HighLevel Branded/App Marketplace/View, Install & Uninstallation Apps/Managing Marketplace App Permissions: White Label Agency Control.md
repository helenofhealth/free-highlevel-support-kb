**Effects of Disapproving:**

* The disapproved apps will no longer be visible or installable at the sub-account level.
* If these apps were previously installed, they will be uninstalled from all associated sub-accounts. This includes any supplementary features, such as custom conversation providers, workflow actions, triggers, and more.
* Disapproved apps can be approved again in the future. However, they won't be automatically reinstalled in sub-accounts where they were previously installed. They need to be manually installed again.
