# **What is OAuth for Marketplace Apps?**

  
OAuth is a secure authorization framework that allows third-party apps to request access to specific parts of your HighLevel account. Apps listed in the Marketplace—or integrated externally—use OAuth links to initiate installation and gain permission to read or modify data like contacts, calendars, conversations, workflows, and more.

  
Before this update, users clicking an OAuth link were redirected without knowing which permissions were being granted. Now, the new OAuth flow provides a full breakdown of the requested permissions, helping users make informed decisions before proceeding.

## **Key Benefits of the New OAuth Experience**

  
**Enhanced transparency and security during app installation.**

This update ensures users have full visibility into the permissions apps are requesting, reducing the risk of unauthorized access and improving trust in integrations.

 • Shows app name and logo before confirming installation

 • Clearly lists all requested permissions (scopes)

 • Educates users on what each permission allows

 • Displays explicit warnings for sensitive permissions like users.write

 • Works across both standard and grey-labeled Marketplace links

 • Supports informed decision-making before granting access

## **How the Updated OAuth Flow Works**

  
**See exactly what you’re authorizing before giving access to a third-party app.**

When a user clicks an OAuth installation link from an app’s integration page, they are directed to a redesigned confirmation screen that includes:

 1\. The app name and branding

 2\. A full list of requested OAuth scopes

 3\. A clear explanation of each scope’s purpose

 4\. Warnings for any sensitive or high-risk access requests

  
This OAuth screen acts similarly to Google’s app authorization prompts, offering users transparency before proceeding.

  
**Example OAuth link format:**

[https://marketplace.gohighlevel.com/oauth/chooselocation?…](https://marketplace.gohighlevel.com/oauth/chooselocation)

## **Grey-Labeled OAuth Page Experience**

  
**Consistent permission visibility across white-labeled Marketplace installs.**

This enhanced OAuth experience is also available on grey-labeled Marketplace URLs like:

```
https://marketplace.leadconnectorhq.com/oauth/chooselocation
```

Users will receive the same clear permission breakdown and security warnings regardless of whether the install is happening on HighLevel’s main domain or a white-labeled version.

## **Understanding App Permissions and Warnings**

  
**Learn what each scope means and when to exercise caution.**

OAuth scopes define what kind of access an app is requesting. For example:

 • contacts.readonly: View your contact list

 • conversations.write: Send messages on your behalf

 • locations.readonly: View account location details

  
If an app requests a **sensitive scope** like:

 • users.write: Modify team member permissions or create new users

  
…you’ll see a bold warning before proceeding.

  
These alerts are intended to flag apps that request deep access and ensure you’re making a deliberate, informed decision.

## **Best Practices for Authorizing App Access**

  
**Follow these tips to protect your data while using third-party apps.**  
  
 • **Review scopes** carefully—don’t authorize blindly.

 • **Only approve apps from trusted developers** or verified partners.

 • **Avoid apps that request more access than they need.**

 • **Regularly review your connected apps** in HighLevel’s settings.

 • **Revoke access** to unused or suspicious apps.

  
To manage app access:

  
 Go to **Settings > Connected Apps** inside your HighLevel dashboard.

**Frequently Asked Questions**

  
**Q: What happens if I deny access at the OAuth screen?**

The app will not be installed or connected. No data will be shared until authorization is granted.

  
**Q: What are “scopes” in OAuth?**

Scopes define what specific data or features an app is allowed to access. They help control and limit what third-party apps can do with your account.

  
**Q: How do I know if a scope is sensitive?**

Scopes like users.write or locations.write will display a special warning on the OAuth screen.

  
**Q: Will this affect apps I’ve already installed?**

No. This feature only applies to new app installations or when an existing app is reauthorized using OAuth.

  
**Q: Can I use this new screen for my private app?**

Yes, private apps using OAuth will also route through the new page and show the same permission details.

**Next Steps**

 • **Audit your current app integrations**: Visit **Settings > Connected Apps**.

 • **Educate your team**: Make sure all users understand how to read OAuth permissions.

 • **Update your app documentation**: If you’re a developer, clearly explain what your app accesses and why.

 • **Use the grey-labeled link**: For branded installs, use

<https://marketplace.leadconnectorhq.com/oauth/chooselocation>
