HighLevel has released usage-based pricing for developers. This means developers can choose to price their custom actions/triggers per execution. Alongside this release, HighLevel is running an experiment to help grow the number of and usage of custom actions/triggers built by third-party developers in our Marketplace. These actions/triggers normally incur a HighLevel “premium action/trigger” charge of $0.01 per execution, but during this experiment, HighLevel will waive those charges for a select group of developers and their apps and limit the per-execution price to the developer's price.

##   

## Why Are We Doing This?

* We believe that the intrinsic value of an action/trigger varies based on the underlying service/feature that the action/trigger powers. Some services, such as email/phone validation, cost less than $0.01 per execution, but the platform fee of $0.01 makes the overall service expensive.
* As part of this experiment, developers can use the new usage-based pricing feature to set their own per-execution charges
* By removing the HighLevel fee, we want to reduce the overall cost to you, the end user. We believe lower overall costs and transparent, developer-set pricing will enable you to use these features/services from the App Marketplace in your workflows.

## What Does This Mean for You?

* Developer-Set Usage-Based Pricing  
   * If a selected developer has usage-based pricing enabled, you will see a per-execution charge from the developer for their app’s custom actions/triggers.
* Variation in Pricing  
   * You may notice that some apps still have a HighLevel per-execution fee, while others do not.  
   * Apps participating in this experiment and choosing to bill their actions/triggers via the HighLevel billing platform will not include the HighLevel premium fee. All you'll need pay is the developer may have their own usage-based pricing.  
   * For developers and apps that are not part of the experiment and choosing to charge a usage-based price for their actions/triggers, you will see two charges  
         * The price set by the developer  
         * The platform fee from HighLevel

  
## How Did We Select the Developers and Apps for the experiment?

HighLevel has identified certain developers and their apps based on:

1. Apps growth potential  
   * The developer’s potential to create and publish multiple apps in the Marketplace that leverage custom actions/triggers. The objective is to incentivise them to grow their number of workflow actions/trigger apps on the marketplace, thereby increasing the number of choices of services/features/integrations on the Marketplace.
2. Usage growth potential  
   * The app’s potential to grow in usage (executions per month), providing clear value to end users.

## What to Expect During the Experiment

* No Additional Premium Fees on Selected Apps  
   * The usual HighLevel charge of $0.01 per execution for premium actions/triggers will be waived for these chosen apps.  
   * You would still be charged a separate usage-based fee set by the developer for the action/trigger.
* Increased Variety of Integrations  
   * We expect more developers to list their apps, offering a broader range of features/services/integrations in the Marketplace.

## FAQs

1. Will this affect the quality or reliability of the apps?  
   * Not at all. This experiment only affects the fees charged by HighLevel. App developers are still responsible for maintaining the quality and reliability of their integrations.
2. What if I have questions about a developer’s usage-based pricing?  
   * Pricing details are set by each developer. You can reach out to the developer directly via their support channels or consult the documentation they provide for clarity on how their pricing structure works.
3. When will this experiment end?  
   * This is a temporary initiative, and we’ll share updates or changes in the future. At any point, selected apps may revert to the standard HighLevel premium action/trigger fee, or they may continue on a revised plan based on the experiment’s results.
