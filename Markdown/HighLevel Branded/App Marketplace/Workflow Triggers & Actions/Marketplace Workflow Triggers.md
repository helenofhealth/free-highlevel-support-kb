Marketplace Workflow Triggers are the customizable workflow triggers managed in [Marketplace](https://marketplace.gohighlevel.com/). You will be able to create custom triggers to push data from your application/API to a workflow.

  
Sign up/ Sign in to [Marketplace](https://marketplace.gohighlevel.com/) to manage Marketplace Workflow Triggers.  
  
Marketplace Workflow Triggers are part of LC Premium Triggers & Actions and are chargeable per execution.  
  
[How to enable and rebill LC Premium Triggers & Actions for Workflows?](https://help.gohighlevel.com/en/support/solutions/articles/48001231559)  
  
You should enable Workflow LC Premium Triggers & Actions for the sub-account to access the Triggers created in the Marketplace App.  
  
The marketplace workflow triggers created in an APP will be listed in the workflow triggers only if the sub-account has the APP installed/integrated from the Marketplace.

## **Can workflow execute without contact?**

* Workflow can run contactless without any Contact data dependency so you can send any payload data via Marketplace Triggers and use it in workflow.
* You can proceed without contact and use actions that are not dependent on contact information. Custom Webhook, Google Sheet, Slack, ChatGPT and all Internal Tools can be executed without contact.
* If necessary, you can use the Create/Update or Find Contact actions to retrieve the contact data to the workflow.  
    
**Example:**
* Send order data to trigger and add the order information to google sheet, use if/else to categorize based on order value and send a slack notification.
* Retrieve the contact with Contact ID using Find contact action
