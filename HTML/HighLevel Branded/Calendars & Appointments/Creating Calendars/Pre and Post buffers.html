This feature can be beneficial if you need extra time to get ready before a meeting, travel to an event, or wrap up after a presentation.

However, blocked slots or events synced from third-party calendars (Google, Outlook, iCloud) are considered when applying buffers. This ensures that buffers do not overlap with blocked slots, providing appropriate buffer times for appointments.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Buffer-Duration-Affecting-Available-Slots"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155008249415/original/Ew_k9fwnbzOx3l7xgYOFgGaaAjPOgYVEfQ.png?1695295311" style="width: auto;" class="fr-fic fr-fil fr-dib fw-lightbox-img" data-attachment="[object Object]" data-id="155008249415" data-index="1"></h3><h3 dir="ltr" id="Buffer-Duration-Affecting-Available-Slots">Buffer Duration Affecting Available Slots</h3><p dir="ltr"><br></p><p dir="ltr">Using the example above, if there's a 30-minute event with 15-minute buffers before and after, someone else booking on the same day will see an available slot 30 minutes after the existing booking.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155008248682/original/ZynVOHKf4olx_WfqBLTqWcqXZDeSk9T9uw.png?1695295018" style="width: auto;" class="fr-fic fr-fil fr-dib fw-lightbox-img" data-attachment="[object Object]" data-id="155008248682" data-index="2"></p><p dir="ltr">It's important to note that when using both Pre and Post buffers, there are instances where seemingly large free periods in the calendar cannot be booked.

For example, if a 30-minute event has 15-minute pre and post buffers, the next appointment will be scheduled 30 minutes after the existing booking. Double buffers can limit seemingly free periods in the calendar, removing significant time slots. To maximize bookable time slots, consider using a single buffer (either pre or post).</p><p dir="ltr"><br></p><p dir="ltr"><strong dir="ltr">Question:</strong> Can I remove or alter a buffer once it's set for a booked appointment?</p><p dir="ltr"><strong dir="ltr">Answer:&nbsp;</strong>Once a buffer is set for a booked appointment, it can be removed or altered. Buffers are applied based on the latest settings.</p><p dir="ltr"><br></p><p dir="ltr"><strong dir="ltr">Question:</strong> What happens if buffer settings are different on an individual's other calendars in a round-robin calendar event?</p><p dir="ltr"><strong dir="ltr">Answer:&nbsp;</strong>In a round-robin calendar event, varying buffer settings on an individual's other calendars can result in an uneven distribution of appointments among users.</p><p dir="ltr"><br></p><p dir="ltr"><strong dir="ltr">Question:</strong> Can buffer settings on an individual's other calendars affect the booking of appointments in a collective calendar event?</p><p dir="ltr"><strong dir="ltr">Answer:&nbsp;</strong>Yes, in a collective calendar event, buffer settings on an individual's other calendars can block available slots that may otherwise appear free due to buffer time occupying those slots.</p><p dir="ltr"><br></p><p dir="ltr"><strong dir="ltr">Question:</strong> What is double buffer?</p><p dir="ltr"><strong dir="ltr">Answer:&nbsp;</strong>Double buffering refers to the use of both pre-buffer and post-buffer times before and after an event or appointment. It means that extra time is added both before and after an event, effectively extending the duration of the buffer. This can result in time slots that appear to be free on the calendar but are not available for booking because the double buffering occupies those time slots. Double buffering reduces the number of bookable appointments within a given timeframe.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>
