It integrates individual team members' availability into a shared calendar, allowing for unified scheduling. This feature facilitates seamless group interactions, perfect for collaborative endeavors like sales calls, technical support, or group interviews.</p><p class="tdfocus-1691037830380" data-identifyelement="990"><br></p><p class="tdfocus-1691037830380" data-identifyelement="990"><br></p><p class="fd-toc"><strong>TABLE OF CONTENTS</strong></p><ul><li><a href="#What-are-Collective-Bookings?">What are Collective Bookings?</a></li><li><a href="#Frequently-Asked-Questions">Frequently Asked Questions</a></li></ul><p class="tdfocus-1691037830380" data-identifyelement="1031"><br data-identifyelement="1032"></p><hr data-identifyelement="1033"><h2 class="tdfocus-1691038269876" data-identifyelement="1034" dir="ltr" id="What-are-Collective-Bookings?"><strong data-identifyelement="1035" dir="ltr">What are Collective Bookings?</strong></h2><p data-identifyelement="1036" dir="ltr">Collective bookings are a sophisticated and efficient approach to concurrently scheduling multiple participant meetings. This scheduling feature allows the synchronization of different team members' schedules to streamline the booking process. It essentially amalgamates the team members' calendars to provide a standard time slot that suits everyone, thus allowing for collective or group bookings.</p><p data-identifyelement="1037"><br data-identifyelement="1038"></p><p data-identifyelement="1039">This functionality is an invaluable asset in several contexts, such as setting up dynamic sales calls that involve an account executive and a sales development representative (SDR), organizing complex technical support calls that require both a customer support rep and an engineer, or conducting insightful interviews involving a recruiter and a hiring manager.</p><p data-identifyelement="1040"><br data-identifyelement="1041"></p><p data-identifyelement="1042">Setting up a collective booking calendar is straightforward. You navigate to Calendars ‚ûù Calendar Settings, click "Create Calendar," and select "Collective Booking." You then fill in the necessary details like the calendar name, team members involved, a custom URL for the calendar, and a meeting location. Once these details are confirmed, your Collective Calendar is ready to go.</p><p data-identifyelement="1043"><br data-identifyelement="1044"></p><p data-identifyelement="1045">A unique aspect of collective Booking is the concept of a 'Primary Owner.' This individual leads the appointment, acts as the appointment owner, and is assigned contacts if contact assignment is enabled. The primary owner is typically the first team member added to the collective Booking, but they can be changed as needed for greater flexibility and efficient team management.</p><p data-identifyelement="1046"><br data-identifyelement="1047"></p><p data-identifyelement="1048">Notification-wise, all team members are alerted when a contact books an appointment. This process ensures that everyone on the team stays informed about each appointment, fostering effective communication and collaboration.</p><p data-identifyelement="1049"><br data-identifyelement="1050"></p><p class="tdfocus-1691038313268" data-identifyelement="1051" dir="ltr">In addition to these features, collective Booking includes payment capabilities if enabled for the calendar. With this, users have to make the payment first, and only after the payment is confirmed does the appointment get booked. This system ensures a seamless, secure transaction process, making the collective booking experience smooth and convenient for both users and customers.</p><p><br></p><hr data-identifyelement="1204"><h2 class="ql-heading" data-block-id="block-7fc950da-5124-4bb0-80f7-1ca08ae77276" data-identifyelement="1205" dir="ltr" id="Frequently-Asked-Questions"><strong data-identifyelement="1206" dir="ltr">Frequently Asked Questions</strong></h2><p><br></p><p class="ql-block" data-block-id="block-d2e1adc4-e0fc-42a0-89ab-4b1ffcc0e9ce" data-identifyelement="1207" id="Question:-How-many-team-members-can-I-add-to-a-single-collective-booking-calendar"><strong data-identifyelement="1208" dir="ltr">Q: How many team members can I add to a single collective booking calendar</strong></p><p class="ql-block tdfocus-1691039561295" data-block-id="block-d681b2d1-e589-4731-91ec-08c290246239" data-identifyelement="1209">Answer: You can add upto 100 team members in a collective calendar, although please remember the more team members lesser the chances of finding available slots across all of them</p><p class="ql-block tdfocus-1691039561295" data-block-id="block-d681b2d1-e589-4731-91ec-08c290246239" data-identifyelement="1210"><br data-identifyelement="1211"></p><p class="ql-block" data-block-id="block-7b7c25ce-e77e-4f3b-b340-fe64564d1e86" data-identifyelement="1212" id="Question:-Would-payments-work-in-Collective-booking?"><strong data-identifyelement="1213" dir="ltr">Q: Would payments work in Collective booking?</strong></p><p class="ql-block tdfocus-1691039580870" data-block-id="block-62e994c2-7e01-4802-999d-6307583f4073" data-identifyelement="1214" dir="ltr">Answer: Yes, payments would work for Collective Booking.</p><p class="ql-block tdfocus-1691039580870" data-block-id="block-62e994c2-7e01-4802-999d-6307583f4073" data-identifyelement="1215" dir="ltr"><br data-identifyelement="1216"></p><p class="ql-block tdfocus-1691039554400" data-block-id="block-a78f882a-2bb9-44df-a6de-79b53f036796" data-identifyelement="1217" id="Question:-Can-I-use-collective-booking-for-virtual-appointments?-"><strong data-identifyelement="1218" dir="ltr">Q: Can I use collective booking for virtual appointments?&nbsp;</strong></p><p class="ql-block tdfocus-1691039559823" data-block-id="block-e8db6a3e-d512-453b-b1a6-8faa58ec094e" data-identifyelement="1219" dir="ltr">Answer: Collective booking can be used for virtual and physical appointments; please add the correct details in the Meeting location field.</p><p class="ql-block tdfocus-1691039559823" data-block-id="block-e8db6a3e-d512-453b-b1a6-8faa58ec094e" data-identifyelement="1220" dir="ltr"><br data-identifyelement="1221"></p><p class="ql-block" data-block-id="block-7e203573-fee9-4a62-a3fb-4b20c78bb403" data-identifyelement="1222" id="Question:-Can-I-remove-a-team-member-from-an-existing-collective-booking-calendar?"><strong data-identifyelement="1223" dir="ltr">Q: Can I remove a team member from an existing collective booking calendar?</strong></p><p class="ql-block tdfocus-1691039600399" data-block-id="block-b6459b5e-44e2-4bc7-857b-b0c2669036df" data-identifyelement="1224">Answer: You can remove any team member from the collective booking calendar except for the Primary owner.
