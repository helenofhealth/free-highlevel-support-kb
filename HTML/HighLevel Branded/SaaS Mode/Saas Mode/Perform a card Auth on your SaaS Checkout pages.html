This is especially useful when you offer a free trial for your subscriptions. It deters bad actors from signing up to your platform and allows only real users with sufficient balance to proceed for the free trial.</p><p dir="ltr"><br></p><h2 dir="ltr">Will my clients be charged for this authorization?</h2><p dir="ltr"><br></p><p dir="ltr">No your clients will not be charged for the authorization because it works by creating a payment intent and immediately refunds it before the charges can be settled. It is only a way to know if the card being used is a real card with sufficient balance.&nbsp;</p>
