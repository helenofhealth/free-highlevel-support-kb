It can be used when contacts meet specific criteria and are no longer needed within the CRM. However, since deleting a contact is irreversible, it is important to configure this action carefully and understand its implications.</p><hr><h2 id="How-to-Use-the-Delete-Contact-Action"><strong dir="ltr">How to Use the Delete Contact Action</strong></h2><p><br></p><p>To use the <strong>Delete Contact</strong> action within a workflow, follow these steps:</p><p><br></p><pre class="fd-callout fd-callout--note" dir="ltr"><span style="font-family: Helvetica Neue;">Remember to <strong>triple check</strong> the filter conditions that qualify a contact for automatic deletion and <strong>test</strong> the workflow before leaving it unattended.
