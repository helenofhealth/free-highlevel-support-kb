Instead of leaving it as the default “Appointment Status,” name it based on its purpose.

Below are the available filters and their operators:</p><p><br></p><h4 id="Filter-By-Event-Type"><strong dir="ltr">Filter By Event Type</strong></h4><p><br></p><p dir="ltr">The Event Type filter allows you to specify which type of appointment should trigger the workflow. This helps ensure that automation is only applied to the relevant appointments based on their scheduling pattern.</p><ul><li dir="ltr"><strong dir="ltr">Any:&nbsp;</strong>Includes all appointment types.</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Normal:</strong> Triggers workflows only for non-recurring appointments.</li><li dir="ltr"><strong dir="ltr">Recurring:</strong> Activates workflows for repeating appointments.</li></ul><p><br></p><h4 id="Filter-By-Appointment-Status"><strong dir="ltr">Filter By Appointment Status</strong></h4><p><br></p><p dir="ltr">The Appointment Status filter allows you to trigger workflows based on specific status changes of an appointment. This ensures that automation is executed only when a particular status condition is met, helping businesses manage follow-ups and engagement effectively.</p><ul><li dir="ltr"><strong>New:</strong> When a new appointment is scheduled.</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Confirmed:</strong> When an appointment is confirmed.</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Cancelled:</strong> If the appointment is canceled.</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Showed:</strong> When the client attends the appointment.</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>No-show:</strong> If the client does not attend.</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Invalid:&nbsp;</strong>If the appointment is marked as invalid.</li></ul><p><br></p><h4 id="Filter-By-&nbsp;Tag"><strong dir="ltr">Filter By &nbsp;Tag</strong></h4><p><br></p><p>The Filter by Tag option allows you to trigger workflows based on specific contact tags assigned in the CRM. Tags are commonly used to categorize contacts based on their attributes, behavior, or engagement level, making it easier to apply targeted automation.</p><p><br></p><p dir="ltr">When this filter is selected, a dropdown menu will display all available tags. Choosing a tag ensures that the workflow only triggers for contacts who have that specific tag assigned, allowing for more personalized and efficient automation.</p><p><br></p><h4 id="In-Calendar-Filter"><strong dir="ltr">In Calendar Filter</strong></h4><p><br></p><p dir="ltr">The In Calendar filter allows you to trigger workflows based on status updates for appointments scheduled in a specific calendar.</p><p><br></p><h4 id="In-Calendar-Group-Filter"><strong dir="ltr">In Calendar Group Filter</strong></h4><p><br></p><p dir="ltr">This filter allows you to trigger workflows based on appointments scheduled within a specific calendar group. This is useful for businesses that manage multiple calendars under a unified group, such as different departments, teams, or service categories.</p><p><br></p><p dir="ltr">When you select this filter, a dropdown menu will appear where you can choose from the available calendar groups. Once selected, the workflow will activate only when an appointment status is updated within the chosen group, ensuring targeted automation for grouped scheduling environments.</p><p><br></p><h4 id="Only-for-Grouped-Calendar"><strong dir="ltr">Only for Grouped Calendar</strong></h4><p><br></p><p dir="ltr">The Only for Grouped Calendar filter allows you to specify whether the workflow should trigger exclusively for grouped calendars or apply to both individual and grouped calendars. This is useful for businesses managing multiple appointment schedules under a single calendar group.</p><p><br></p><ul><li dir="ltr"><strong>Yes:&nbsp;</strong>Workflow will trigger only for grouped calendars.</li><li><strong>No:</strong> Workflow will trigger for both grouped and individual calendars.</li></ul><p><br></p><h4 id="Modified-By"><strong dir="ltr">Modified By</strong></h4><p><br></p><p dir="ltr">The Modified By filter allows you to control when the workflow should trigger based on who made changes to the appointment status. This is useful for tracking updates made by different sources, ensuring the right actions are automated accordingly.</p><p><br></p><ul><li dir="ltr"><strong>API:</strong> Trigger fires when an appointment status is updated via API.</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Customer:&nbsp;</strong>Trigger activates when a client makes an appointment change.</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>User:&nbsp;</strong>Workflow runs when a manual update is made by a user. When you select this filter, you will be able to select the individual CRM user in the next step so the trigger only gets activated when the selected user have made modifications.</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Workflow:&nbsp;</strong>Trigger fires when another workflow modifies the appointment status.</li></ul><p><br></p><p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155041186061/original/mls2UPOGXwB9dUTMMJG_mdKRAibYlAuPeg.gif?1738920342" style="width: auto; max-width: 100%;" class="fr-fic fr-fil fr-dib fr-bordered fw-lightbox-img" data-attachment="[object Object]" data-id="155041186061" data-index="3"></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><h3 id="Step-5:-Saving-and-Activating-the-Trigger"><strong>Step 5: Saving and Activating the Trigger</strong></h3><p><br></p><p dir="ltr">Once all filters are set, click <strong>Save</strong> to store the trigger configuration.
