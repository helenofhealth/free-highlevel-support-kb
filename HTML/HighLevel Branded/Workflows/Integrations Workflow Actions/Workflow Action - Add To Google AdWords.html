This feature is ideal for tracking offline conversions—such as form submissions, chat replies, purchases, or appointment bookings—that happen after a user clicks your ad.

This step-by-step guide walks you through how to configure the action inside a workflow, including where to find it, how to set it up, and how to ensure it’s firing correctly.</p><p dir="ltr"><br></p><p dir="ltr"><br></p><pre class="fd-callout fd-callout--note" dir="ltr"><strong dir="ltr"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,sans-serif;">Connect Your Google Ads Account</span></strong><span dir="ltr" style="font-family: Helvetica,sans-serif;">

In order to use the “Add to Google AdWords” workflow action, you must first connect your Google Ads account to HighLevel. This integration enables HighLevel to send conversion events directly to Google Ads via API. To set it up, navigate to <strong>Settings &gt; Integrations</strong> in your HighLevel sub-account, select Google, and follow the prompts to authenticate your account. Be sure to link the correct Google Ads account, especially if you manage multiple. Without this connection, the action will not function, regardless of how well everything else is configured.</span></pre><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><pre class="fd-callout fd-callout--note" dir="ltr"><span dir="ltr" style="font-family: Helvetica Neue;"><strong>Important:</strong></span>

<span dir="ltr" style="font-family: Helvetica Neue;">After connecting your Google Ads account to HighLevel, you must already have at least one conversion action created inside your Google Ads account. HighLevel fetches available conversion actions directly from Google Ads during setup. If no conversion actions exist yet, the dropdown menu for selecting a conversion event inside the workflow will be blank.</span></pre><br><p><br></p><p><br></p><h3 id="Step-1:-Access-the-Workflow-Builder"><strong>Step 1: Access the Workflow Builder</strong></h3><p><br></p><p dir="ltr">To begin, head over to the Automation section inside your HighLevel sub-account. This is where you manage and create all your workflows. You can either Click + Add New Workflow to start from scratch, or Select an existing workflow where you’d like to add the Google Ads conversion action.</p><p dir="ltr"><br></p><p dir="ltr"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155043968374/original/C5OqPiVY-2ShM2wPKh6trOdfVoaD9ob5Tw.png?1742958934" style="width: auto; max-width: 100%;" class="fr-fic fr-fil fr-dib fr-bordered fw-lightbox-img" data-attachment="[object Object]" data-id="155043968374" data-index="0"></p><p dir="ltr"><br></p><p><br></p><pre class="fd-callout fd-callout--note"><span dir="ltr" style="font-family: Helvetica,sans-serif;">Once inside the workflow builder, your first task is to ensure you have a relevant workflow trigger set up. This trigger should reflect the action or event you want to track—like a form submission or an appointment booking.

Examples of effective triggers include: Form Submitted, Appointment Booked, Trigger Link Clicked, or Customer Replied</span></pre><p><br></p><p><br></p><h3 id="Step-2:-Add-the-“Add-to-Google-AdWords”-Workflow-Action"><strong>Step 2: Add the “Add to Google AdWords” Workflow Action</strong></h3><p><br></p><p dir="ltr">After your trigger is in place, click the<strong>&nbsp;“+”</strong> icon at the point in the workflow where you want the conversion to fire. This opens the action selection panel.

This step involves linking your workflow to the proper conversion event and ensuring all tracking parameters are accurately in place. Missteps here—such as typos in the conversion name or missing click IDs—can prevent your conversion from syncing entirely.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><pre class="fd-callout fd-callout--note" dir="ltr"><strong dir="ltr"><span dir="ltr" style="font-family: Helvetica,sans-serif;">Preparing Google Ads Conversion Setup</span></strong><span dir="ltr" style="font-family: Helvetica,sans-serif;">

Before configuring the “Add to Google AdWords” workflow action in HighLevel, there are three critical steps you must complete within Google Ads:

<strong>1. </strong>Create the conversion action inside your Google Ads account—this defines the specific event you want to track, such as a form submission or appointment booking.

<strong>2. </strong>Copy the exact conversion name from Google Ads and use it precisely as-is in your HighLevel workflow action. Any mismatch in the name, even due to capitalization or spacing, will prevent the action from working.

<strong>3. </strong>Ensure that your ad URLs include proper click tracking parameters: use <strong>GCLID</strong> for Search campaigns, and <strong>GBRAID</strong> or <strong>WBRAID</strong> for iOS and Android app campaigns. HighLevel must capture these identifiers from incoming leads to pass accurate attribution data back to Google Ads. 

Without these prerequisites, conversion syncing will fail. Additionally, be aware of your conversion setting type—if your conversion is set to <strong>“One Per Click,”</strong> GCLID is required, as GBRAID and WBRAID only support <strong>“Many Per Click”</strong> tracking. This distinction is especially important when troubleshooting missed or skipped conversions.</span></pre><p><br></p><p><br></p><h4 id="Action-Name"><strong>Action Name</strong></h4><p><br></p><p>Give your action a clear and descriptive name—something like “Submit Lead Conversion” or “Book Appointment Conversion.” This name will appear in your workflow logs, so it should clearly reflect what the conversion is for.</p><p><br></p><p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155043968320/original/yc46jH8_fGYYUJCiqGcTrxTiyez7q4mOAw.png?1742958741" style="width: auto; max-width: 100%;" class="fr-fic fr-fil fr-dib fr-bordered fw-lightbox-img" data-attachment="[object Object]" data-id="155043968320" data-index="2"></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><h4 id="Conversion"><strong>Conversion</strong></h4><p><br></p><p dir="ltr">In this dropdown, select or paste the exact name of the conversion event from your Google Ads account.

This is where selecting the right trigger becomes crucial. Popular Triggers Include:</p><p dir="ltr"><br></p><ul><li dir="ltr"><strong>Form Submitted:</strong> Ideal for capturing leads from opt-in or contact forms.</li></ul><p><br></p><ul><li dir="ltr"><strong>Appointment Booked:&nbsp;</strong>Tracks booked meetings or sales calls.</li></ul><p><br></p><ul><li dir="ltr"><strong>Trigger Link Clicked:&nbsp;</strong>Measures high-intent actions like pricing clicks.</li></ul><p><br></p><ul><li dir="ltr"><strong>Order Form Submission:</strong> Captures purchase-based conversions.</li></ul><p><br></p><ul><li dir="ltr"><strong>Customer Replied (Chat Widget):&nbsp;</strong>Tracks incoming messages from your site chat.</li></ul><p><br></p><p><br></p><h3 id="Step-5:-Monitor-Workflow-Execution-Logs"><strong dir="ltr">Step 5: Monitor Workflow Execution Logs</strong></h3><p><br></p><p>Once your workflow is active, it’s important to monitor its execution to ensure the action is firing properly.</p><p dir="ltr">Go to the Execution Logs tab within the workflow.

Even a small mismatch in the conversion name will prevent the event from registering correctly in Google Ads.</p><p><br></p><p><span style="color: rgb(44, 130, 201);"><strong>Q: What’s the difference between GCLID, GBRAID, and WBRAID?</strong></span></p><p><span dir="ltr"><strong>GCLID:&nbsp;</strong>Used for traditional web tracking.</span></p><p><span dir="ltr"><strong>GBRAID/WBRAID:</strong> Used in privacy-focused environments (mainly on iOS).</span></p><p>Only “multi-per-click” conversions accept GBRAID/WBRAID. If your conversion setting is “one per click,” GCLID is required.</p><p><br></p><p><span style="color: rgb(44, 130, 201);"><strong>Q: Can I track leads that come through the chat widget?</strong></span></p><p>Yes. Use the Customer Replied trigger and add a filter: Reply Channel = Chat Widget. This ensures the event only fires when a user replies via the widget.</p><p><br></p><p><span style="color: rgb(44, 130, 201);"><strong>Q: Do I need to configure anything in Google Ads before using this?</strong></span></p><p dir="ltr">Yes. Before using the “Add to Google AdWords” action in HighLevel, you need to ensure your Google Ads account is properly configured. First, create the conversion action directly within your Google Ads account. Then, copy the exact name of that conversion—making sure it matches character-for-character—and paste it into the workflow action in HighLevel. Finally, confirm that your Google ad URLs are correctly passing tracking parameters like GCLID, GBRAID, or WBRAID to ensure conversions can be properly attributed back to the original ad click.</p><p><br></p><p><span style="color: rgb(44, 130, 201);"><strong>Q: Is Google Tag Manager required for this to work?</strong></span></p><p dir="ltr">No. This action does not require Google Tag Manager. However, GTM can still be helpful if you’re tracking additional client-side events.</p>
