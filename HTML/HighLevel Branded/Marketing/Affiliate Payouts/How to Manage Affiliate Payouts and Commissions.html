However, the system does not automatically track refunds for one-time products or subscriptions.</li><li><strong>Subscription Cancellations</strong>: The Affiliate Manager administrator can choose to issue payments <strong>15, 30, or 60 days after the sale</strong> to allow enough time to handle potential cancellations. If a subscription is canceled, the lead is moved to the <strong>churned category</strong> but can be re-activated later.</li><li><strong>One-Time and Recurring Commissions</strong>: Commissions can be one-time or recurring, depending on the product sold through Stripe.</li><li><strong>Coupons and Discounts</strong>: If a discount is applied during checkout, the commission is calculated based on the <strong>discounted amount</strong>.</li></ul><hr><h2 class="ql-heading" data-block-id="block-9ca6f448-40dc-4916-912a-a8c5ea006ae5"><strong dir="ltr">Payout Terms</strong></h2><p dir="ltr">Payout terms let you set a delay between when a commission is earned and when it’s paid out — ideal for businesses with refund windows. For example, if you offer 30-day refunds, you can set a NET-30 payout to ensure commissions are only paid after that period.</p><p><br></p><h3><strong>Supported Payout Terms:</strong></h3><p><br></p><ul><li dir="ltr">NET-7 – 7 days after month end</li><li dir="ltr">NET-15 – 15 days after month end</li><li dir="ltr">NET-30 – 30 days after month end</li><li dir="ltr">NET-45 – 45 days after month end</li><li dir="ltr">NET-60 – 60 days after month end</li><li>NET-90 – 90 days after month end</li></ul><p><br></p><p>You can configure payout terms in:</p><p><br></p><ol><li dir="ltr">Campaign &gt; Additional Settings</li><li dir="ltr">Global Settings</li><li dir="ltr">Affiliates can view the payout term inside their portal.</li></ol><p class="ql-block" data-block-id="block-39257802-c35e-4835-b82c-afb1f9838d2e" dir="ltr"><br></p><hr><h2 class="ql-heading" data-block-id="block-9ca6f448-40dc-4916-912a-a8c5ea006ae5"><br></h2><h2 class="ql-heading" data-block-id="block-9ca6f448-40dc-4916-912a-a8c5ea006ae5" id="How-to-Navigate-the-Payouts-Tab"><strong dir="ltr">How to Navigate the Payouts Tab</strong></h2><p class="ql-block" data-block-id="block-39257802-c35e-4835-b82c-afb1f9838d2e">When you access the <strong>Payouts</strong> screen, you'll see four sub-tabs representing different payout statuses:</p><ol><li><strong>Pending</strong>:<ul><li>Displays all pending payouts for each campaign, organized month-wise.</li><li>Affiliate owners review and approve eligible affiliate payouts by clicking on the three dots to see the breakdown at the campaign and month levels.</li><li>If a payout isn’t applicable, the owner can select <strong>Deny Payout</strong>, moving the entry to the "Denied Payout" tab.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Approved for Payout</strong>:<ul><li>Once payouts are approved in the Pending tab, they move here.
