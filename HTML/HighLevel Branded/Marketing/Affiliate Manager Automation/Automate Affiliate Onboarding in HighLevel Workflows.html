This can happen either manually or automatically, and the trigger is especially useful for streamlining affiliate onboarding and internal team communication. When activated, it unlocks access to detailed affiliate data, including their name, email, phone number, campaign name, total revenue, commission earned, referral link, portal link, and magic login link. These custom values can then be used in emails, SMS messages, internal notifications, or CRM updates—making it easy to personalize outreach, track affiliate performance, and improve the overall onboarding experience. This trigger only appears if the Affiliate Manager is enabled and at least one affiliate campaign exists in the sub-account.</p><hr><h2 id="Key-Benefits-of-Affiliate-Enrolled-In-Campaign-Workflow-Trigger"><strong>Key Benefits of Affiliate Enrolled In Campaign Workflow Trigger</strong></h2><p class="p2"><br></p><p class="p3">This trigger unlocks automation opportunities that enhance affiliate onboarding, internal tracking, and campaign engagement.

To enable it, go to Settings &gt; Affiliate Manager and activate the toggle. Then, create a campaign under the Affiliate Manager tab. Once both are active, you’ll be able to see the trigger inside the workflow builder under the “Affiliate” category.</p><p class="p1"><br></p><p class="p1"><strong dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(44, 130, 201);">Q: Can I use this trigger to onboard affiliates differently depending on which campaign they joined?</span></strong></p><p class="p2" dir="ltr">Yes! You can apply <span class="s2"><strong>filters by campaign</strong></span> when setting up the trigger. This allows you to run different workflows or branches of logic depending on which campaign the affiliate joined. For example, you might send one welcome email for your “Course Affiliate Program” and a different one for a “Product Launch Campaign.” You can also add conditional steps or use tags for segment-based actions.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong dir="ltr"><br></strong><strong dir="ltr"><span dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(44, 130, 201);">Q: Why do my affiliate custom values (e.g., referral link or magic login link) appear empty in the email/SMS step?</span></strong></p><p class="p1" dir="ltr">Affiliate custom values such as the referral link, portal link, or magic login link will only populate if the workflow includes the “Affiliate Enrolled In Campaign” trigger and is triggered by an actual affiliate enrollment event. These values are dynamic and tied specifically to the trigger event, meaning they won’t appear or function correctly unless the workflow is activated by a real affiliate joining a campaign. If you’re seeing blank values, ensure that the workflow is being tested with a valid affiliate record that has been added to a campaign, and that the trigger is correctly configured and saved. The custom values will then be available under the “Affiliate Enrolled In Campaign” section when inserting variables into your emails or SMS steps.</p><p class="p1" dir="ltr"><br></p><p class="p1"><strong><span style="color: rgb(44, 130, 201);">Q: What happens if I enroll an affiliate manually—will the trigger still fire?</span></strong></p><p class="p2" dir="ltr">Absolutely. The trigger is activated whether the affiliate is enrolled <span class="s2"><strong>automatically</strong></span> (via forms, funnels, or sign-up links) or <span class="s2"><strong>manually</strong></span> (added directly by your team inside the Affiliate Manager). As long as the enrollment happens and matches the filter criteria (if set), the workflow will trigger and execute the steps you’ve configured.</p></div>
