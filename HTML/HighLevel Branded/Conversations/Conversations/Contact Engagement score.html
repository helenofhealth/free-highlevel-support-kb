    <p data-identifyelement="498" dir="ltr">The Contact Engagement Score is a metric that helps businesses track, prioritize, and engage with leads based on their level of interaction. By assigning scores to actions like email opens, form submissions, and purchases, businesses can focus on high-score leads ready for conversion while nurturing low-score leads to improve engagement. In this article, you’ll learn how to set up engagement scoring, where to view scores in the platform.</p><hr data-identifyelement="499"><p class="fd-toc"><strong>TABLE OF CONTENTS</strong></p><ul><li><a href="#What-is-Contact-Engagement-Score?">What is Contact Engagement Score?</a></li><li><a href="#Where-to-View-Contact-Engagement-Scores">Where to View Contact Engagement Scores</a></li><li><a href="#Understanding-Action-Types-in-Engagement-Score-Rules-%C2%A0">Understanding Action Types in Engagement Score Rules &nbsp;</a></li><li><a href="#How-to-Set-Up-and-Manage-Score">How to Set Up and Manage Score</a></li><li><a href="#Frequently-Asked-Questions">Frequently Asked Questions</a></li></ul><hr><p class="fd-toc" data-identifyelement="502" dir="ltr"><span class="fr-video fr-deletable fr-fvc fr-dvb fr-draggable" data-identifyelement="503"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0GlOL4KYjx4?&amp;wmode=opaque" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="" class="fr-draggable" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-forms allow-same-origin allow-presentation" data-identifyelement="504"></iframe></span></p><hr data-identifyelement="507"><h1 data-identifyelement="508" id="What-is-Contact-Engagement-Score?"><strong data-identifyelement="509">What is Contact Engagement Score?</strong></h1><p data-identifyelement="510"><br data-identifyelement="511"></p><p data-identifyelement="512" dir="ltr">The Contact Engagement Score is a numerical value that tracks how actively a contact interacts with a business. Each interaction impacts the score based on predefined rules. Positive actions like link clicks or payments increase the score, while negative actions like email bounces or unsubscribes reduce it. This ensures the score accurately reflects a contact’s engagement level.</p><p data-identifyelement="519"><br data-identifyelement="490"></p><p data-identifyelement="519"><span data-identifyelement="491" dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: -apple-system, &quot;system-ui&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; font-weight: 400; text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; display: inline !important;">By assigning points to actions like email opens, form submissions, and purchases, businesses can prioritize high-value leads while identifying those needing more nurturing.</span></p><hr data-identifyelement="492"><h2 data-identifyelement="522" id="Where-to-View-Contact-Engagement-Scores"><strong data-identifyelement="523" dir="ltr">Where to View Contact Engagement Scores</strong></h2><p data-identifyelement="524"><br data-identifyelement="525"></p><p data-identifyelement="526" dir="ltr">Users can access engagement scores in different sections of the platform to quickly gauge a contact’s level of interaction.

Can I apply different engagement score rules to different contact segments or lists?</strong></span></p><p>Yes, but not directly within the Manage Score section. Engagement scoring applies to all contacts globally. However, you can create smart lists or use tags and custom fields to segment contacts and apply engagement-based workflows that trigger different actions based on specific criteria.</p><p><br></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(44, 130, 201);"><strong>Q. Does the engagement score automatically decrease over time if a contact stops interacting?</strong></span></p><p>No, HighLevel’s engagement score does not include an automatic score decay feature. If you want scores to decrease for inactive contacts, you’ll need to set up an automation workflow using timed triggers that subtract points when a contact hasn’t interacted within a certain period (e.g., no email opens or replies in 60 days).</p><p><br></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(44, 130, 201);"><strong>Q. Can I assign different weightings to the same action based on different conditions?</strong></span></p><p>Currently, the Manage Score section does not support condition-based weightings for the same action. However, you can create multiple rules for similar actions with different triggers. For example, you can assign +5 points for clicking a regular email link but +10 points for clicking a high-priority promotional link using different trigger conditions.</p><p><br></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(44, 130, 201);"><strong>Q. How does the engagement score affect automated workflows, and can I trigger multiple workflows based on score changes?</strong></span></p><p>Yes! Engagement scores can be used as workflow triggers in the Automations section. You can create workflows that launch when a contact’s score crosses a threshold (e.g., greater than 20) to trigger sales outreach, email sequences, or nurture campaigns. Multiple workflows can be triggered based on different score levels to automate lead qualification and engagement strategies.</p><p><br></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(44, 130, 201);"><strong>Q. Can I track historical engagement score changes to see how a contact’s engagement evolves over time?</strong></span></p><p dir="ltr">Currently, HighLevel does not provide a built-in historical log for engagement score changes. However, you can work around this by logging engagement score changes in a custom field or using an automation workflow to store score snapshots at regular intervals. This allows you to track engagement trends and analyze how a contact’s interaction level changes over time.</p>
