These apps must not contain any references to Highlevel or Gohighlevel in their app properties, details, or on the company website. Any such references will result in disapproval during the app review process by the marketplace team.</p><p><br></p><p>Agencies and sub-accounts under white-label domains will only be able to install these apps. Given the nature of their type, white-label verified apps tend to have a broader reach as they are listed for both white-label and non-white-label agencies and sub-accounts. Therefore, it is recommended to fully white-label your app for maximum visibility.</p><p><br></p><p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155017605606/original/K3FlvnaGuITOxzKP4H-RNHmb0IgApAhQpw.png?1705140958" style="width: auto;" class="fr-fic fr-fil fr-dib fw-lightbox-img" data-attachment="[object Object]" data-id="155017605606" data-index="0"></p><p></p>
