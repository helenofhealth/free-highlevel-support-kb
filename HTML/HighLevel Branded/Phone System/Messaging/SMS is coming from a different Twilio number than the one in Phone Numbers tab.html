This happens due to a specific regulation in Mexico for mobile text messages.</p><p><br></p><p>In Mexico, AT&amp;T is the only mobile company that allows texts to be sent from a regular phone number. These messages are primarily intended for person-to-person, or P2P, conversations. According to the rules, if more than nine texts are sent from the same number in less than two minutes, the system automatically changes the <strong>'Sender ID'</strong> - the number from which the message appears to be sent. This is done to comply with Mexico's regulations.</p><p><br></p><p dir="ltr">Therefore, if your messages are appearing from a different number, it's due to this regulation being applied.
