This is a good indicator of a healthy reputation.</li><li><strong>10% spam or higher</strong>: Some emails are being classified as spam. Check your sending practices, content, and lists to avoid deliverability issues.</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Blocked Status</strong></p><ul><li><strong>No</strong>: Your IP is not blocked. It can send emails without restrictions.</li><li><strong>Yes</strong>: Your IP is blocked due to possible spam behavior or policy violations. Immediate steps are required to investigate the root cause and resolve the issue.</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Trap Hits</strong></p><ul><li><strong>0 Trap Hits</strong>: Your IP is not interacting with spam traps. This is ideal for maintaining a clean sender reputation.</li><li><strong>One or More Trap Hits</strong>: Spam traps are receiving your emails. This suggests that your list may contain invalid or suspicious addresses. Clean your list to prevent further damage to your reputation.</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Complaint Rate</strong></p><ul><li><strong>&lt;0.1%</strong>: A complaint rate below 0.1% is excellent and shows that recipients are generally satisfied with your emails.</li><li><strong>&gt;0.1%</strong>: A higher complaint rate indicates that recipients are marking your emails as spam. Review your email content and ensure your recipients have opted in.</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>RCPT Commands</strong></p><ul><li>This represents the total number of recipients who received your emails.
