Start by giving your assignment a <span class="s2"><strong>title</strong></span>, which will be displayed to learners. If the assignment doesn’t require grading, you can enable the <span class="s2"><strong>Ungraded Assignment</strong></span> checkbox to allow submissions without evaluation. You can upload a <span class="s2"><strong>thumbnail image</strong></span> to visually represent the assignment—this is especially helpful for branding or content recognition.</p><p class="p3"><br></p><p class="p1" dir="ltr">In the <span class="s2"><strong>Instructions</strong></span> section, add clear guidance to help learners understand what is expected in their submission. Use formatting tools to emphasize important information or include hyperlinks to relevant resources. The <span class="s2"><strong>Upload Templates</strong></span> area allows you to upload supporting documents or starter files (.docx, .pdf, .pptx, etc.) that students can use to complete the assignment. Finally, use the <span class="s2"><strong>Confirmation Message</strong></span> field to customize the message learners see after submitting their work. This can be a motivational note, next steps, or simply a thank-you message to reinforce the completion. These tools work together to create a more engaging and informative assignment experience within your membership product.</p><p><br></p><p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155044472307/original/2GL6F2JZE-FYuzWP2iE4RiIBer4jEgRYpw.png?1743681938" style="width: auto; max-width: 100%;" class="fr-fic fr-fil fr-dib fr-bordered fw-lightbox-img" data-attachment="[object Object]" data-id="155044472307" data-index="6"></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><h3 id="Quiz-Editor:-Setup-and-Customization-Options"><strong>Quiz Editor: Setup and Customization Options</strong></h3><p><br></p><p class="p1">After selecting <span class="s1"><strong>Quiz</strong></span> as the assessment type, you’ll be taken to the <span class="s1"><strong>quiz configuration editor</strong></span>, where you can build and customize the entire quiz experience.

If you want to assess learner performance, enable the checkbox for <span class="s1"><strong>“This quiz requires passing grade”</strong></span> and enter the required <span class="s1"><strong>Passing Grade</strong></span> percentage to define what qualifies as a successful completion.</p><p class="p2"><br></p><p class="p1">You can enhance the quiz visually by uploading a <span class="s1"><strong>Quiz Thumbnail</strong></span> image—this gives learners a branded or themed visual cue for the quiz. Below that, use the <span class="s1"><strong>Pass Confirmation Message</strong></span> and <span class="s1"><strong>Fail Confirmation Message</strong></span> fields to write personalized feedback that learners will see based on their performance. These editors support text formatting, links, and embedded content, so you can include detailed guidance, encouragement, or even resource links.</p><p class="p2"><br></p><p class="p1" dir="ltr">Once the setup is complete, click on the <span class="s1"><strong>Add Question</strong></span> button to begin building your quiz.
